      "I wanted to buy a lightweight, yet powerful laptop for college and was considering buying a Windows 8 machine until I found this laptop on eBay. It is the absolute perfect weight and has that sophisticated style that any college student can appreciate. The i5 processor completes any task given to it with ease. I enjoy mostly everything about the laptop with the minor exceptions being the battery life and lack of a higher resolution display. At a rated 7 hours it is nothing to sneeze at, but watching videos and extensive use will shorten the overall time. I know the latest generation Intel chips have solved this problem and it is not a fault of the machine itself. The screen is bright and vivid, although recent full HD, 4K, even Apple's own Retina display best this unit's 1440 x 900 resolution. Compared to other laptops, this wins hands down! The PC's I considered had sturdy builds, but the reputation that Windows 8 has and Apple's ability to build great laptops sealed the deal. With the few minor gripes I have, emphasis on minor, this is a great overall laptop and one that I would recommend to anyone. Apple built a workhorse of a laptop and one that will be able to take whatever the average user will throw at it.Read full review...\n",

      "I was a Macbook Pro user until I found this little gem. Machine is a refurbished unit but looks and performs like new with Mojave OS. Wasn't sure about the 4 GB Ram but it works extremely well and does everything asked of it. Lightweight design makes it a lot easier to take anywhere.Downside is the upgradeability isn't as quick and easy as the old Macbook Pro. Memory is soldered into the motherboard.Read full review...\n",
      "After being a loyal MacBook Pro fan, I have finally switched over to the MacBook Air.  The newest generation MacBook Air packs a powerful i5/i7 that easily outperforms my 2009 2.66Ghz Intel Dual Core Macbook Pro.  The battery life is amazing, I'm able to get very close to what Apple has quoted, and having a Solid State Drive, the battery can stay charged for literally weeks when in sleep mode, forget about turning this laptop off!  The boot times are phenomenal, and will surpass any Macbook with a traditional HDD.  I love how portable this laptop is, its extremely lightweight and much more bag friendly than my 15.4\" MacBook Pro.  This laptop is going to be more than perfect for you if you like to browse the web, watch videos, edit documents, or edit pictures.  Now, if your needing more power for gaming or memory intensive programs such as Adobe Illustrator, I would suggest looking into a MacBook.  But, for most users, I believe this laptop will more than fit the everyday users needs.  I'm confident that this laptop will stay modern and compatible with all Apple software for another 4 or 5 years, and I'm even more confident that this laptop will hold its value for several years, I believe that the Intel i5/i7 processors will be here for awhile, and over the next few years, solid state drives are going to grow even more popular.Read full review...\n",
      "he 2012 MacBook Air no longer stands as the coolest Mac laptop: that crown has been temporarily stolen by the Retina Display MacBook Pro. Nor is it as unusual. However, it still remains the best example of an ultrathin laptop -- for its construction quality, performance, and ergonomics.The 13-inch Air has the same looks as last year, and nearly the same build, with a few key differences: a new third-gen Intel Core i5 processor, USB 3.0 ports (replacing the previous USB 2.0), a higher-def 720p Webcam, and an altered MagSafe 2 charge cable and connector. Also, both 13-inch MacBook Pro models now cost $100 less, bringing the entry-level model with 128GB solid-state drive (SSD) to $1,199, the exact same cost as the 13-inch MacBook Pro.Read full review...\n",

Although it didn't come with an internal CD/DVD R/RW drive, it had the usb connections that would support the these external devices.  I would not give up this MacBook Air lap top for another PC.

      "I Got this computer and was amazed of how good the battery life is, for the things that i want is a perfect fit, if you want to do editing or need a lot of hard drive space (for HI DEF Movies and stuff) maybe this is not a very cost effective option but for mid range to casual user or a college student this is a great choice.One of the most portable computers out there and a great value, if you can get a 2011 or 2012 model with 128Gb for under 1,100 go for it. Some people complain about not being able to burn a CD since it doesn't have CD/DVD/R/W but theres a lot of options of external drives out there and this might be a factor to consider if you burn a lot of CD's all the time.I don't find myself doing it very often so is not an issue for meNo complains on performance yet.Read full review...\n",
      "Love how it boots up immediately. Everything about it is faster. Always wanted to try an SSD and willing to live with the smaller (120GB) storage for the faster response and bootup time. I keep the drive lean and use an external FW (w/Thunderbolt-to-FW adapter) when needed. I don't use a lot of CPU-intensive applications. Display is crisp and bright, tho not a retina. Haven't noticed any issues w/battery--seems to hold a decent charge when I've used it, tho haven't actually timed it. Ships with Mountain Lion, which I've already come to love.Read full review...\n",

The day I got it back I tried to watch a movie on it and the screen is screwing up. If I send it back I'll have to pay shipping.

      "Okay so 2 things:1) itâ€™s not turning on, the unit sounds like itâ€™s powering up with no start up chime & you can only hear the fan turning on full blast.  There is nothing on the screen, itâ€™s just black.I took it into my local Apple  store to investigate and they said itâ€™s a dead SMC/ the logic board is dead and has to be replaced. Iâ€™m not okay with that.2) you didnâ€™t even send the OEM charger?  This thing is HUGE and says 85w, doesnâ€™t fit in the slot, & it was under the plastic insert.Read full review...\n",

      "A laptop with 12 hours of battery life, a fast SSD, and extremely thin and light design for a competitive price? This is one of the best computers Apple makes. It is easy to carry around, has all day battery life, and almost matches equally configured Ultrabooks. Only gripes are rather slow 1.3 GHz i5 processor, and integrated HD 5000 Graphics, which might not be enough for some users. But for everybody else, it is amazing.

      "The Macbook is a superb laptop as long as your priority is small and light. It's monitor is especially good. It also comes with 8GB of RAM and 256 GB of solid state hard drive. While it's certainly not the fastest processor available, it's the quietest and able to do most jobs other than intense video processing or gaming, but then if you had those apps, you wouldn't be likely to get one in the first place.The bottom line is there's very little out there than can match the Macbook in its area of expertise, especially if you also have other Apple products and want to coordinate amongst them.Read full review...\n",

      "I had no idea of how terrific this Macbook Pro really was. I had notice an explosive proliferation in this computer, so I suspected there really was something special about it, I had a MacPro for many years for editing movies and pictures. I grew to love the Apple ecosystem, and the fact that once you learn how to maneuver in the system, It is the way computing should have been all along. I had been a pc advocate, using different brands like Dell and H-P. When the Windows 10 OS came out it was the last straw. PC laptops I had been buying were so cheaply and shoddily designed that they were finally obsolescent. The Macbook Pro is ruggedly built, incredibly well designed, including the retina display that blows me away every day. It comes with the best OS on the planet. The battery is long lived and it recharges quickly. One major advantage is that this machine is usable as soon as you turn it on and login. Not like a pc that is rendered unusable at login or at some arbitrary point you choose to receive updates.The major items that made this a great buy for me are the following:Value from the Apple ecosystem.Value from the great design and rugged construction.Value from high quality audio system for streaming video, and enjoying music.Value from the brilliant retina display.Value from the lighted keyboard.Value from the well cared for computer by the original owner.Best value of all was the third party software already installed by the previous owner. The Microsoft Office for Mac 2011, and CS6 Photoshop, Aperture.Read full review...\n",
      "This MacBook Pro is an absolutely beautiful machine. I had issues with my 2011 Mac and so I decided to upgrade to this one, three years newer. For being only three years newer, it's night and day different than the 2011. For starters, it's way lighter and sleeker. I really love the feel and look of this model, 2014. It is very responsive and the screen, it's a beauty.I wish I had bought one with a bigger hard drive but, for the price I paid for this one, I'll live with the smaller hard drive. If you're on the fence about the 2014 MacBook Pro, rest assured that it's all that the descriptions says, and so much more. I will not be uploading pics because I just got it and really don't feel like taking photos of it right now but, believe me, it's really nice.Read full review...\n",

      "With the new MacBooks expected some time this fall, this appeared to be a temporary price drop for this machine. I am guessing that, eventually, this price will return for those with patience.The MBP saw its last smaller upgrade a few months ago, but the design itself a few years old by now.  Nonetheless, this MBP does have  a major plus for me over the new versions, purportedly arriving with 4 USB-C ports only:  adapter-free compatibility with everything I need - HDMI, USB 3 and SDXC.  This is important to anyone who has to work with colleagues still using thumb drives, CDs, SD cards and date projectors without Apple TV.Initially, I was slightly concerned about the legitimacy of the product, but it came NIB, all original parts, wrappings with seals intact and the ability to purchase full 3-year AppleCare.Read full review...\n",
      "Apple's 15.4\" MacBook Pro w/Retina Display & ForceTouch Trackpad is a truly redefining piece of unprecedented technology designed and assembled to increase the range, demand, and atmosphere of consumer productivity across all platforms. By transforming the machine itself, Apple presents a durable and promising tool that suits mediums established on professional, personal, and educational levels for an experience harnessed by the computer's multifunctional abilities. Not only does the MacBook Pro exceed traditional options in performance, but also with its stunning power to become singular in the routines of the user. Altogether, Apple's MacBook Pro w/Retina Display sets a new standard in its field, made specifically for every aspect of imagination.Read full review...\n",
      "This computer is absolutely wonderful.  The 2015 MacBook Pros are the best laptops I've seen, including Apple's more recent models.  Super light; sleek; huge, beautiful display; fast; silent; reliable; good autosaving if you let the battery run out; great keyboard and trackpad; nice speakers; still has the ports that are most important to me; doesn't get particularly warm, even with extended use; good OS options. My only complaints so far aren't about the computer itself. 1) The charger it came with burned out within a month and might have been a fake. I solved this with an old charger and the $10 Magsafe 1 to 2 adapter from Apple. 2) Pages is currently a terrible program compared to Word or Apache. But those are just tangential issues, not the computer itself. I love this laptop and will recommend it as the best all around laptop till Apple fixes the butterfly keys and other issues with the new Macs, or another company surpasses it.Read full review...\n",
      "Well, I did not expect it would be as it was shown in the pictures! But this seller just surprised me! I was thrilled when the computer arrived in just 3 days of time and it was in excellent condition. The computer works perfectly! tested the product thoroughly before even installing my old computer's backup into this machine. Drained the battery out and filled back to see how it is! But again, that surprised me too! I meant to say that the battery is in excellent condition. The MacBook Pro Retina display 15inch Mid2015 is $1895 on Amazon and expensive in others that I looked and finally ended up giving it a try on eBay. But this seller has just sold me $1249. Plus, I've got Keyboard cover, snap cover for the machine, also MS Office 2016. And the fact I like about this seller is that he's instantly responsive to your text or message :) I was answered all the questions instantly or no later than an hour. Highly recommended! You don't get such a seller in these day and age on eBay. Note: Don't worry about the scam!! This seller is totally genuine!Read full review...\n",
      "In a time where the cost is more for less this hardware stands out as a good buy.Has all the speed, storage, and memory that most users would ever need. The display is still very crisp and meets or beats a lot of other machines on the market. It has all the ports that I still use and are more than efficient or sufficiently available for media needs without carrying multiple adapters. Light weight enough for everyday carry. (Not many people I know hike 10 miles on foot into work).So yes, a great value in an overpriced economy for machines that barely if at all best the 2015 rMBP.Read full review...\n",
      "At $1,599 could not have received a better value than the 15\" MacBook Pro. There are zero complaints. Move my wife from the Windoze platform that I just \"worked on everyday to keep running\" to a platform that you can really use and get things done, especially with this awesome laptop. Mac is just a pleasure to use. Screen is outstanding, Memory at 16 gb is awesome and the HD is lightning. Bought it before the new one got too small and couldn't use all the great accessories I already have with my 13\" MacBook Pro. If you find it on sale, pull the trigger.Read full review...\n",
      "With the the release of the 2016 Macbook's closing in, it's a good time to buy last year's models because they're dropping in price. I use this machine for Web Dev and I love it. The 15.4 inch screen real estate is awesome and allows me to have many things going on at once. Also the retina display is fantastic. I'm overall really pleased with this device. I recommend this to any developer or average consumer, it's a very nice machine. Read full review...\n",
      "I bought this to replace my aging 2011 Macbook Pro. Just about everything has been improved - it's lighter, sleeker, has USB 3 ports, has a Retina display, better colors, better sound, MUCH faster PCI based storage. Definitely a huge improvement if you have an older Macbook Pro, and the last model before Apple replaced all the ports with lightning ports, removed the MagSafe adapter, and removed the SD card reader. If you're upgrading from an older model, THIS is definitely the model to get at this time.Read full review...\n",

Perfect for my job as a marketer.Read full review...\n",
      "This is simply the best notebook there is. I'm a long time ThinkPad fan, had several models, but when Apple debuted the first Unibody MacBook Pro, I had to make the switch. Since then, Apple has been on the crown.Apple does not make these without SSDs - so every single MacBook is FAST. Always easily outperforms 95% of all Windows Laptops simply because of the usage of a SSD. People think they need a faster CPU to browse the web - none sense. Most people don't use fast CPUs. This Laptop has performance where it matters the most.The weight and battery life are outstanding and industry leading. They are very thin. They are seamless, no competitor is able to produce a clean chassis like this one. The brand is instantly recognized every on the planet.Let's face the truth, if you sit down with a Dell or HP in a Starbucks, you look like you're a worker bee, putting in extra hours on the weekend. These devices have no sex in them. The MacBook Pro is the laptop that everybody desires. You know it.Read full review...\n",
      "Its a mid to high end laptop from the apple lineup and not everyone may want to pay the premium for it.Very fast and responsive.

      "Great laptop! Yes itâ€™s from 2015 but donâ€™t let that stop you. This thing is fast, light for its size, has all the ports you need built in so you donâ€™t need an adaptor. It comes in very good condition, mine only had the most minor scuffs on the bottom and a tiny dent that is only visible under perfect lighting. It even handles video editing and video games nicely. Overall, for the price Iâ€™m thrilled with this laptop and I would buy it again.Read full review...\n",

Startup is instant and I never have to reboot! Need a new laptop, go for a mac!Read full review...\n",
      "I decided to make the switch to Mac OS after my Windows laptop died and this Apple MacBook Pro fits the bill. It's lightweight, very powerful and is surprisingly easy to use. I've never used Mac OS and there is a bit of a learning curve, but once you get the hang of where things and how to navigate it's quite simple to use. Love the snappy backlit keyboard and I'm banking on that Apple dependability for many years to come. Highly recommend for anyone on the fenceRead full review...\n",

      "This was one of the biggest purchases I have ever made, so I was very hesitant. I've been needing a good laptop for college coming up as well as needing it to edit my photos. I wanted to get a good quality one with good storage and a larger screen. For everything I wanted, new it would've been around $2,000+. This is a pretty decent price for all that it is I would say.

      "Although it may not give the best bang for the buck value as compared to windows laptops in terms of immediate components, Apple has created a device that is optimized to do what it is meant to do, and what it does do, it does better than anything that windows can offer.

      "For any price under $1600 it is a steal! The performance is great and the quality is top notch. With the new Mac Books set to be release in late October grabbing a heavily discounted older model is a great alternative! If your lucky enough to still be eligible for Apple care protection I would also invest in that too. Extending your warranty for three more years for support in case of any issues.  *Side note* The new Mac books may not even have the standard USB ports and HDMI port. Rumor has it they are set to be released with USB C which could add extras fees for people who need to purchase adapters and such.Read full review...\n",

      "The new 13-inch Apple MacBook Pro brings a lot of new features to the table from the previous generation. Users now get a large battery that gives pretty amazing life, a better display, faster processor, FireWire, SD-card slot, and best of all a lower starting price. Getting more for less seems to be the trend during this slow economy, so is there any reason not to buy the new 13\" MacBook Pro?Build and DesignThe 13.3\" MacBook Pro is very sleek and classy, which is what we have come to expect from Apple. The design is sharp with the unibody chassis showing no panel lines or breaks except on the bottom for the huge panel that covers the internals. Apple gives us a very simple interface with little clutter (and ports) turning what is usually a mindless appliance into a work of art. To further simplify the design they switched to an internal battery for this model, instead of having a cover and release bar like in the previous revision.MSRP: $1,199PROS:-Excellent battery life-Great build quality-SD-card slot!CONS:-This notebook gets hot!-Good looks, poor ergonomics-Slow hard drive13-inch Apple MacBook Pro Specifications:-Mac OS X v10.5.7 (9J3032)-Intel Core 2 Duo P8400 2.26GHz (3MB L2 cache, 1066MHz -frontside bus)-2GB 1067MHz DDR3 SDRAM-160GB 5400rpm SATA hard disk drive-13.3\" glossy widescreen TFT LED backlit display (1280 x 800)-NVIDIA GeForce 9400M graphics (256MB of DDR3 shared memory)-8x slot-loading SuperDrive (DVDÂ±R DL/DVDÂ±RW/CD-RW)-iSight webcam-AirPort Extreme WiFi (IEEE 802.11a/b/g/n)-Bluetooth 2.1 + EDR (Enhanced Data Rate)-Mini DisplayPort, Ethernet, two USB 2.0 ports (480Mbps), -----FireWire 800, Audio out and microphone in, SD-Card reader-Dimensions : 0.95\" x 12.78\" x 8.94\" (H x W x D)-Weight: 4.51 pounds (A bit on the heavy side)-Integrated 58-watt-hour lithium-polymer battery-60W MagSafe power adapter with cable management systemRead full review...\n",
      "I was afraid to get the laptop at first but it works better than I expected. Their is only one dent on the corner and itâ€™s not anything too drastic. The screen works fine too and it charges well. The only problem is I wasnâ€™t expecting to have a Spanish keyboard but itâ€™s not that different. Also my sound may stop working occasionally but itâ€™s rare. It doesnâ€™t take pictures either! Camera still works but no pictures. Luckily I only need mine for typing and work. Besides the keyboard and the sound everything else is great.Read full review...\n",
      "I love this Mac! It has the perfect amount of hard drive space! I love it because it has enough space to be a great Mac as well as space to left over to run Windows which I use for when Mac won't run a Windows application. I did upgrade the RAM as I notice it lag just a little bit and now it runs very smooth.Came with lots of extra applications above the stock ones which was nice as well!Read full review...\n",
      "I received mine with a couple decent scratches on the lid (expected) and a faint dark spot in the middle of the screen thatâ€™s apparent on a light background but other that, Iâ€™m satisfied.  Everything works great and the inside surface is very clean.  I plan to upgrade to an SSD, 8GB of RAM and a new battery and with that my total investment is still under $500....good luck finding a better laptop with similar performance at that price.Read full review...\n",
      "I ordered this laptop Feb 26, it was shipped Feb 27th and it was delivered a few hours ago today! It came in a discreet box and was well protected inside. Power chord was included. There were a few scratches and dents but not anything major. Iâ€™ve only been using it for a few hours and Iâ€™ve noticed the MacBook gets really hot, but other than that it works perfectly fine and I will definitely be a return customer! Only rated it 4/5 because I havenâ€™t had it long enough to give it 5/5. But so far Iâ€™m very pleased with my purchase.Read full review...\n",
      "My concerns at downsizing to a 13 inch lap top have been erased as I find the weight and size more convenient for every day use without any negatives in practical use.As a musician, I use my MacBook for live recording and for composition and find the battery life to be fine.The speed is amazing and Apple's Garage Band, I Movie and I DVD make production a joy.There's no doubt that the initial outlay of money is high, but the ease of use, and the elegance of the operating system make this a great value.Read full review...\n",

      "great price, fast delivery, love computer and good purchasing experience. Computer does everything that my business requires and is much more affordable than newer mac laptops. Macs just rock, anyone purchasing computer for first time be it retired folks or younger students this is the computer for you. Easy to learn operation and super fun to play with. These computers are fast and user friendly. The storage space is huge if compared to file cabinets and should last for years. Personally, I have never had a problem with Mac breakdowns. I just purchased this model and it is the 5th mack i have bought over the last 5 years. One for each member of my family. We all love them.

      "Considering it is a late 2011 MacBook Pro it has very good specs. Decent amount of hard drive space for a mix of creative projects and customary work or school use.

First impression i thought it had a little more cosmetic damage then i was expecting such as dents and overall fragilness.

I have downloaded the latest apple OS mavericks as well as the latest versions of iTunes without any problems.

      "I've only had my MacBook Pro for almost two weeks now, but so far I love it! I was afraid of opening it to many scratches, marks, etc., but have found little to none. Internally, I have found absolutely no problems (plan to come back if I get any). It is very fast and like new. Great battery life which I particularly appreciate. I am very happy with my purchase, especially at the price, as I have wanted a MacBook for a while and needed a new laptop for my college work-- this has so far proved to be perfect for me. I also decided to get the two-year warranty offered to me after purchase. None of my friends believe the deal that I got, and I still don't.Read full review...\n",

The screen and keyboard were great condition.When you start it up, itâ€™ll be restored to its original settings which really date this laptop.

I didn't know how to fix the issue with the keyboard so I was stuck with sticky keys for a few months. Next thing you know, the Macbook stops working and I had to contact the ItsWorthMore for help. I previously tried to do some self troubleshoot but they told me that since I opened the Macbook that my warranty was VOIDED.

      "j'ai pas gagner l'enchere mais on me la colerbought the NewPhone 74205 three weeks ago and was immediately impressed with the number of features available on this inexpensive phone. It has a 1M-pixel camera, video camera, and speakerphone. The NewPhone's size is perfect for carrying in a pocket and the battery has a pretty good lifespan of roughly 4 hours. My only complaint is that the menu system on the phone makes you click four times before you can find someone in the address book, set an alarm, or perform a additional functions. Other phones I've owned have simpler menus and get you to important features easily. Overall, I'd recommend the phone if you're on a budgetRead full review...\n",

      "Works well for a kid's remote-learning tool, where a current Macbook or Macbook air would be overkill (and twice as expensive), but still runs MacOS. The screen isn't the highest-resolution retina type, but it's bright and more than enough for worksheets and the like. Speakers are plenty loud for schoolwork. Pretty good battery life, even with  300 cycles already at the time of purchase. Sturdy - survived a tumble down the stairs with a pretty big dent but no loss of functionality as far as I can tell. I don't think this 2017 model air has a T2, so it hopefully will be possible to upgrade the ssd later if needed.Read full review...\n",
      "Just arrived with a huge dent in it after long wait without a computer. Box wasn't very sturdy, no packing slip.. but pristine, so didn't happen in shipping.  A dent this significant at least deserved mention in the item description. No I need to hire a tech to look at it to make sure the connections and everything else is ok. I don't see how a dent this bad didn't damage delicate connection. This was also a very important and very expensive investment for me living on fixed income of about $730/mo, a Covid survivor who is still very sick and has been depending on laptop for shopping, video doctor visits,  paying bills, and so on, so paying for a tech and living with this uncertainty is very troubling.

      "This is a 2017 MacBook Air and the quality is great. Not a lot of memory but that can be fixed with an external drive. The screen looks awesome for those people that are working with photo shop or any kind of visual effects. The Mac is very light and at 13.3â€ this laptop in not to big and not to small, itâ€™s just a perfect size. If your looking for a good quality MacBook Air this is the computer for you but remember that this middle doesnâ€™t have a lot of memory and if your working on videos of high quantity of photos, your going to need an external drive.Read full review...\n",

      "Best value for money, not just from apple, but compared to any existing laptop out there. Light, amazing battery life, great durability and impressive performance!long version:I've been using the Air series for the past 6 years (so has my wife) and i have to say that there are only words of praise! It is extremely reliable, very good battery and very lightweight.I use it mainly for business which involves a lot of coding, but i often use image and video editors and it never felt lagging. And this is while having on average 60 browser tabs opened almost constantly!I recommend you to buy it if you're a student, freelancer, traveling or moving around a lot. Here are some useful tips that might save you plenty of headache:- the retail price is around 1000$ and depending on the model goes higher. But from my experience, you should be able to get a deal of 750$ at least once in 2 months, so don't rush throwing away the cash!- pay attention to sweaty palms (they may leave a permanent whitish stain), wearing metal armbands/watches and cufflinks (may scratch the thin side).- the most fragile element of all is the power cord. Make sure you don't wrap the cord very tightly when transporting it;- the biggest enemy of the battery seems to be Chrome. I can normally use it with 60 tabs for 4-5 hours, but i heard others getting way more time if using safari, so keep that in mind.Read full review...\n",

Once I set that up, setting the MacBook up was a breeze. I purchased this on sale in November and got a great deal, but it is a great deal at regular price.

      "After 9yrs with my 1st MacBook, it was time for an upgrade. This MacBook Air did not disappoint. Fast and works flawlessly. My only minor gripe would be that the metal edges of the laptop's body is a bit sharp and tends to dig into the skin. An after market plastic case remedied the issue, but for the price of these laptops, Apple should smooth out the edges. With that said, I absolutely love this laptop, and hopes it holds out just as long as my first one.Read full review...\n",

       " \"I wanted to buy a lightweight, yet powerful laptop for college and was considering buying a Windows 8 machine until I found this laptop on eBay. It is the absolute perfect weight and has that sophisticated style that any college student can appreciate. The i5 processor completes any task given to it with ease. I enjoy mostly everything about the laptop with the minor exceptions being the battery life and lack of a higher resolution display. At a rated 7 hours it is nothing to sneeze at, but watching videos and extensive use will shorten the overall time. I know the latest generation Intel chips have solved this problem and it is not a fault of the machine itself. The screen is bright and vivid, although recent full HD, 4K, even Apple's own Retina display best this unit's 1440 x 900 resolution. Compared to other laptops, this wins hands down! The PC's I considered had sturdy builds, but the reputation that Windows 8 has and Apple's ability to build great laptops sealed the deal. With the few minor gripes I have, emphasis on minor, this is a great overall laptop and one that I would recommend to anyone. Apple built a workhorse of a laptop and one that will be able to take whatever the average user will throw at it.Read full review...\",\n",

       " 'After being a loyal MacBook Pro fan, I have finally switched over to the MacBook Air.  The newest generation MacBook Air packs a powerful i5/i7 that easily outperforms my 2009 2.66Ghz Intel Dual Core Macbook Pro.  The battery life is amazing, I\\'m able to get very close to what Apple has quoted, and having a Solid State Drive, the battery can stay charged for literally weeks when in sleep mode, forget about turning this laptop off!  The boot times are phenomenal, and will surpass any Macbook with a traditional HDD.  I love how portable this laptop is, its extremely lightweight and much more bag friendly than my 15.4\" MacBook Pro.  This laptop is going to be more than perfect for you if you like to browse the web, watch videos, edit documents, or edit pictures.  Now, if your needing more power for gaming or memory intensive programs such as Adobe Illustrator, I would suggest looking into a MacBook.  But, for most users, I believe this laptop will more than fit the everyday users needs.  I\\'m confident that this laptop will stay modern and compatible with all Apple software for another 4 or 5 years, and I\\'m even more confident that this laptop will hold its value for several years, I believe that the Intel i5/i7 processors will be here for awhile, and over the next few years, solid state drives are going to grow even more popular.Read full review...',\n",
       " 'he 2012 MacBook Air no longer stands as the coolest Mac laptop: that crown has been temporarily stolen by the Retina Display MacBook Pro. Nor is it as unusual. However, it still remains the best example of an ultrathin laptop -- for its construction quality, performance, and ergonomics.The 13-inch Air has the same looks as last year, and nearly the same build, with a few key differences: a new third-gen Intel Core i5 processor, USB 3.0 ports (replacing the previous USB 2.0), a higher-def 720p Webcam, and an altered MagSafe 2 charge cable and connector. Also, both 13-inch MacBook Pro models now cost $100 less, bringing the entry-level model with 128GB solid-state drive (SSD) to $1,199, the exact same cost as the 13-inch MacBook Pro.Read full review...',\n",

I grew to love the Apple ecosystem, and the fact that once you learn how to maneuver in the system, It is the way computing should have been all along. I had been a pc advocate, using different brands like Dell and H-P. When the Windows 10 OS came out it was the last straw. PC laptops I had been buying were so cheaply and shoddily designed that they were finally obsolescent. The Macbook Pro is ruggedly built, incredibly well designed, including the retina display that blows me away every day. It comes with the best OS on the planet. The battery is long lived and it recharges quickly. One major advantage is that this machine is usable as soon as you turn it on and login. Not like a pc that is rendered unusable at login or at some arbitrary point you choose to receive updates.The major items that made this a great buy for me are the following:Value from the Apple ecosystem.Value from the great design and rugged construction.Value from high quality audio system for streaming video, and enjoying music.Value from the brilliant retina display.Value from the lighted keyboard.Value from the well cared for computer by the original owner.Best value of all was the third party software already installed by the previous owner.

I am guessing that, eventually, this price will return for those with patience.The MBP saw its last smaller upgrade a few months ago, but the design itself a few years old by now.  Nonetheless, this MBP does have  a major plus for me over the new versions, purportedly arriving with 4 USB-C ports only:  adapter-free compatibility with everything I need - HDMI, USB 3 and SDXC.  This is important to anyone who has to work with colleagues still using thumb drives, CDs, SD cards and date projectors without Apple TV.Initially, I was slightly concerned about the legitimacy of the product, but it came NIB, all original parts, wrappings with seals intact and the ability to purchase full 3-year AppleCare.Read full review...',\n",

Super light; sleek; huge, beautiful display; fast; silent; reliable; good autosaving if you let the battery run out; great keyboard and trackpad; nice speakers; still has the ports that are most important to me; doesn't get particularly warm, even with extended use; good OS options. My only complaints so far aren't about the computer itself. 1) The charger it came with burned out within a month and might have been a fake. I solved this with an old charger and the $10 Magsafe 1 to 2 adapter from Apple. 2) Pages is currently a terrible program compared to Word or Apache. But those are just tangential issues, not the computer itself.

       " 'The new 13-inch Apple MacBook Pro brings a lot of new features to the table from the previous generation. Users now get a large battery that gives pretty amazing life, a better display, faster processor, FireWire, SD-card slot, and best of all a lower starting price. Getting more for less seems to be the trend during this slow economy, so is there any reason not to buy the new 13\" MacBook Pro?Build and DesignThe 13.3\" MacBook Pro is very sleek and classy, which is what we have come to expect from Apple. The design is sharp with the unibody chassis showing no panel lines or breaks except on the bottom for the huge panel that covers the internals. Apple gives us a very simple interface with little clutter (and ports) turning what is usually a mindless appliance into a work of art. To further simplify the design they switched to an internal battery for this model, instead of having a cover and release bar like in the previous revision.MSRP: $1,199PROS:-Excellent battery life-Great build quality-SD-card slot!CONS:-This notebook gets hot!-Good looks, poor ergonomics-Slow hard drive13-inch Apple MacBook Pro Specifications:-Mac OS X v10.5.7 (9J3032)-Intel Core 2 Duo P8400 2.26GHz (3MB L2 cache, 1066MHz -frontside bus)-2GB 1067MHz DDR3 SDRAM-160GB 5400rpm SATA hard disk drive-13.3\" glossy widescreen TFT LED backlit display (1280 x 800)-NVIDIA GeForce 9400M graphics (256MB of DDR3 shared memory)-8x slot-loading SuperDrive (DVDÂ±R DL/DVDÂ±RW/CD-RW)-iSight webcam-AirPort Extreme WiFi (IEEE 802.11a/b/g/n)-Bluetooth 2.1 + EDR (Enhanced Data Rate)-Mini DisplayPort, Ethernet, two USB 2.0 ports (480Mbps), -----FireWire 800, Audio out and microphone in, SD-Card reader-Dimensions : 0.95\" x 12.78\" x 8.94\" (H x W x D)-Weight: 4.51 pounds (A bit on the heavy side)-Integrated 58-watt-hour lithium-polymer battery-60W MagSafe power adapter with cable management systemRead full review...',\n",

My only complaint is that the menu system on the phone makes you click four times before you can find someone in the address book, set an alarm, or perform a additional functions.

Light, amazing battery life, great durability and impressive performance!long version:I've been using the Air series for the past 6 years (so has my wife) and i have to say that there are only words of praise! It is extremely reliable, very good battery and very lightweight.I use it mainly for business which involves a lot of coding, but i often use image and video editors and it never felt lagging. And this is while having on average 60 browser tabs opened almost constantly!I recommend you to buy it if you're a student, freelancer, traveling or moving around a lot. Here are some useful tips that might save you plenty of headache:- the retail price is around 1000$ and depending on the model goes higher. But from my experience, you should be able to get a deal of 750$ at least once in 2 months, so don't rush throwing away the cash!- pay attention to sweaty palms (they may leave a permanent whitish stain), wearing metal armbands/watches and cufflinks (may scratch the thin side).- the most fragile element of all is the power cord. Make sure you don't wrap the cord very tightly when transporting it;- the biggest enemy of the battery seems to be Chrome. I can normally use it with 60 tabs for 4-5 hours, but i heard others getting way more time if using safari, so keep that in mind.Read full review...\",\n",

Love how it boots up immediately. Everything about it is faster. Always wanted to try an SSD and willing to live with the smaller (120GB) storage for the faster response and bootup time. I keep the drive lean and use an external FW (w/Thunderbolt-to-FW adapter) when needed. I don't use a lot of CPU-intensive applications. Display is crisp and bright, tho not a retina. Haven't noticed any issues w/battery--seems to hold a decent charge when I've used it, tho haven't actually timed it. Ships with Mountain Lion, which I've already come to love.Read full review...

I've had nothing but issues with this laptop since I got it. One week after I received it I discovered that the battery was completely dead. Sent it back to repair which took almost 2 weeks. The day I got it back I tried to watch a movie on it and the screen is screwing up. If I send it back I'll have to pay shipping. I've had the use of this computer for a total of 12 days out of the more than a month since I paid for it.Read full review... Okay so 2 things:1) itâ€™s not turning on, the unit sounds like itâ€™s powering up with no start up chime & you can only hear the fan turning on full blast.  There is nothing on the screen, itâ€™s just black.I took it into my local Apple  store to investigate and they said itâ€™s a dead SMC/ the logic board is dead and has to be replaced. Iâ€™m not okay with that.2) you didnâ€™t even send the OEM charger?  This thing is HUGE and says 85w, doesnâ€™t fit in the slot, & it was under the plastic insert.Read full review...

MacBook came quickly, nicely packed and ready to go! Iâ€™m happy with it! Itâ€™s my first MacBook so I am glad I could find one at a reasonable price.

The computer was an excellent quality, as described, arrived with extremely solid padding to ensure its safety, and works perfectly. Thank you-highly recommended.Read full review... A laptop with 12 hours of battery life, a fast SSD, and extremely thin and light design for a competitive price? This is one of the best computers Apple makes. It is easy to carry around, has all day battery life, and almost matches equally configured Ultrabooks. Only gripes are rather slow 1.3 GHz i5 processor, and integrated HD 5000 Graphics, which might not be enough for some users. But for everybody else, it is amazing. Best part: it boots up in 12 seconds!Read full review... i am loving my Apple laptop.I have more learning to do, but it sure is fun!!! I absolutely love it. I was so not expecting it to come in two days already! Always wanted a MacBook and thanks to you I finally got one at a great price and great quality ! Thank you!! Arrived early, in great shape, runs well. Would purchase again. Now my kids want one exactly like it. Although this Mac book Air is 4 years old it's in like new condition. This is my first Mac so I'm still getting use to it. Bad. Untrustworthy. Computer has no desktop. Reboot does not result in any desktop. Just this white screen with blinking manila folder question mark image. Will not buy from Steele Merce again. I was quite skeptic at first considering Iâ€™ve never bought a laptop online and wow it was the best decision I made. For $270 bucks, you canâ€™t beat it at all. It works perfectly, is b+ condition and is beautiful. LOVING ITRead full review... Purchased the Apple MacBook Air 13\" Intel Core i5 1.8GHz 4GB 128GB SSD and it is fair and working well for me for my school project. kudos to you and i will keep supporting our business. Got this for my daughter to go to college with, works great and she loves it! I purchased this to replace an iPad which was too limited in it's functionality. This is almost as light and portable but with all of the conveniences of a laptop computer (except for the lack of a CD/DVD drive which can easily be purchased and connected via USB in the future) and ethernet connection if you need wired internet access.I have had several MacBook Pro laptops and this rivals all of them in performance and quality of the sound. Also, the screen resolution is actually better than the 13\" MacBook Pro and has the same resolution as the 15\" Model.Read full review... HORRIBLE VALUE! HORRIBLE WARRANTY!! Paid for extra warranty and NOTHING was covered!  VERY disappointing.  Took it in for second opinion and received a totally different answer!  NOT RECOMMENDING THESE PEOPLE!!Read full review... Although EXPENSIVE compared to similar laptops, this one is really great. Outstanding performance, really fast and great (incredible) graphics. Battery life, though, could be very short if you use it out of the plug constantly.  Besides that, this is a really nice laptop with great construction materials and portable (very light).Read full review... Love the computer,works perfectly. A very little dent can hardly see it. Runs smoothly. Love love it. Thanks guys. This product is exactly as describedâ€”not a scratch on it! And the packaging was smart and secure! It even came a day early.Iâ€™m truly happy with my purchase, and itâ€™s good know that honest people still exists :D Read full review... Computer was in great shape, order came early, and I am in love with my new Mac! Thanks and hope to buy from you again in the future my wife loves it. Letâ€™s just say you went above and beyond. Exactly as described.  Showed up USPS in the original box.  I really appreciate a good deal for a laptop for my HS daughter whoâ€™s college bound!! The computer isnâ€™t bad looking itâ€™s slow. But my issue is the camera just doesnâ€™t work at all itâ€™s just a blank screen when I go to use it. This is awesome product and there was only one dent in the product and the Mac itself ran great you will never find a MacBook this cheap or at this good of quality ever ðŸ’¯ðŸ’¯ if your reading this I recommend you get it while they lastâ€¼ï¸Read full review... Laptop has good aspect and works very well I went in for a local pickup and the overall transaction process was alright. At first I believe they had misplaced my order, but then upgraded me at no cost and gave me the same product I had ordered. Now yes, there are some white pixel spots on the screen which I do not appreciate but then again this is a used computer.Keep in mind while buying anything used there will be wear and tear along with scratches, scuffs and etc...BUT If you are ever in the market for a used Macbook or any mac product BUY HERE!!! THEY ARE VERY GOOD.Read full review... Iâ€™ve had this computer for over a year. So far itâ€™s running great. Came with some dents, but I knew it wasnâ€™t brand new. Totally recommend it. I was very impressed when I received my MacBook Air. Everything works great on it and it feels brand new! This is a good, solid system that will be a workhorse! Easy to use, lightweight, works great.

Booyah!!!  =D This MacBook looks new ! Omg I can't really happy at the moment !!!! The Laptop was as represented. Excellent value! Right off the bat, I noticed the screen had a halo around the Apple logo and then the T key fell off so Iâ€™ll have to spend extra to fix. This machine is in excellent condition.

She was able to load all of her information to the computer and now all she needs to do is keep those â€œAâ€™sâ€ . Read full review... The Macbook is a superb laptop as long as your priority is small and light. It's monitor is especially good. It also comes with 8GB of RAM and 256 GB of solid state hard drive. While it's certainly not the fastest processor available, it's the quietest and able to do most jobs other than intense video processing or gaming, but then if you had those apps, you wouldn't be likely to get one in the first place.The bottom line is there's very little out there than can match the Macbook in its area of expertise, especially if you also have other Apple products and want to coordinate amongst them.Read full review... Iâ€™ve had this for quite sometime now and forgot to leave a review.  Everything was perfect thank you!  I love this MacBook!

The MacBook was listed as an open box item which had me skeptical, but it was basically brand new with only 1 battery cycle. Love this MacBook. Itâ€™s fast, and got everything you need to get the job done. Shipping on the item was also amazing, arriving on my doorstep in less than 24 hours. I highly recommend this computer and the listing. You wonâ€™t be disappointed.Read full review... Great laptop - nice and fast with nothing that has bogged it down so far. Touch ID and Touch Bar is nice. Only downside is the battery does not last near 10 hours like they quote. I'd say about 6 hours is normal. Read full review... Brand new in box, top quality product ! Better price than other outlets based on same specifications. The MacBook Pro was labeled open box and was about $400 off. I found no problems with the computer. It is new and functions well. I was shocked how perfect it came for a used product! Would definately recommend. The listed price on apple is $1799 and the price was $1349 for an open box. It was basically new without any scratches or any signs of wear. Also the product came in two days. Recommend 10/10! Mac is running great and looks awesome. I had some doubts because it is open box but came as new. Thanks! came in perfect cosmetic condition. the battery had 22 cycles on it. I didnâ€™t realize how slow my old Mac was until I upgraded - #lovingit! Verified purchase:Â  Yes | Condition:Â pre-owned | Sold by:Â preownedtech Very pleased. Clean and ready to set up! IT'S A DRAWING! NOT A MACBOOK PRO. MAKE SURE YOU READ THE DESCRIPTION. IT'S A DRAWING! Just as described. Great deal. Excellent Product was in perfect conditon. Not a scratch on the laptop, came with charger and charging port. Charging port had some miner scratching, but works perfectly fine. Came in a different box, but was exactly how it was described in the description. Amazing quality and speed! Verified purchase: Yes | Condition: Pre-owned Exactly as described! Verified purchase: Yes | Condition: Pre-owned Like new! I love it, thank you. I need it for studying and it works beautifully Verified purchase: Yes | Condition: New Good Product - Great Price Perfect! Verified purchase: Yes | Condition: Pre-owned I had no idea of how terrific this Macbook Pro really was. I had notice an explosive proliferation in this computer, so I suspected there really was something special about it, I had a MacPro for many years for editing movies and pictures. I grew to love the Apple ecosystem, and the fact that once you learn how to maneuver in the system, It is the way computing should have been all along. I had been a pc advocate, using different brands like Dell and H-P. When the Windows 10 OS came out it was the last straw. PC laptops I had been buying were so cheaply and shoddily designed that they were finally obsolescent. The Macbook Pro is ruggedly built, incredibly well designed, including the retina display that blows me away every day. It comes with the best OS on the planet. The battery is long lived and it recharges quickly. One major advantage is that this machine is usable as soon as you turn it on and login. Not like a pc that is rendered unusable at login or at some arbitrary point you choose to receive updates.The major items that made this a great buy for me are the following:Value from the Apple ecosystem.Value from the great design and rugged construction.Value from high quality audio system for streaming video, and enjoying music.Value from the brilliant retina display.Value from the lighted keyboard.Value from the well cared for computer by the original owner.Best value of all was the third party software already installed by the previous owner. The Microsoft Office for Mac 2011, and CS6 Photoshop, Aperture.Read full review... This MacBook Pro is an absolutely beautiful machine. I had issues with my 2011 Mac and so I decided to upgrade to this one, three years newer. For being only three years newer, it's night and day different than the 2011. For starters, it's way lighter and sleeker. I really love the feel and look of this model, 2014. It is very responsive and the screen, it's a beauty.I wish I had bought one with a bigger hard drive but, for the price I paid for this one, I'll live with the smaller hard drive. If you're on the fence about the 2014 MacBook Pro, rest assured that it's all that the descriptions says, and so much more. I will not be uploading pics because I just got it and really don't feel like taking photos of it right now but, believe me, it's really nice.Read full review... The macbook came clean and very few to unnoticeable minor scratches just on the bottom of the macbook. Theres only one problem. The problem is that I canâ€™t find one problem wrong with it. Itâ€™s pretty fast and no errors. Charging cable came brand new with mac os catalina freshly installed. Best laptop Iâ€™ve had since my HP elitebook 8770W.Read full review... It's wonderful Apple MacPro retina, speed is superb and very convenient and easy to use. Editing and loading photos is 100% hazel free. This is the entry level 15.4 size Mac Pro. For developers this is better than the 13.3 inc with dual core. If you plan to do lots of video editing, then you may need to up size the RAM to 16 vs 8. Also if you need more storage and RAM go with ME294 vs ME293. But for a developer this is the best value.Read full review... If youâ€™re just getting into the world of apple and you want a laptop- skip the MacBook Air. The sheer performance of the MacBook Pro Retina computers will knock your socks off. Thereâ€™s not much you canâ€™t do on these laptops- not to mention that the display is absolutely beautiful. Overall, this is a very good Mac. 10/10 recommended.Read full review... Until Thunderbolt ports are doubled up on EVERYthing, I think this is the last great Mac laptop... it's still has it's Firewire ports AND a Thunderbolt port AND 2 USBs, and separate sound in and out, AND a built-in CD/DVD reader/writer. Retina, for me, is not worth giving all that up for.Sure, time marches on, but we don't have to be manipulated to being in the very front of the line.Read full review... Verified purchase:Â  Yes | Condition:Â pre-owned | Sold by:Â pacificmacs Amazing. This surpassed all expectations I had going into this. I was hesitant buying a used computer online, but they responded to any questions I had. The computer is in near perfect condition and my goodness is it fast. I had no idea how badly I needed to upgrade. I am now a forever customer.Read full review... great computer fast easy to use but lacks a disc drive also does not come with Microsoft office which means additional cost. I would recommend the macbook pro but not the retina display one This computer  has everything I need, it's fast and it has a large clear screen which makes it great for editing photos.  It came with the latest software, and I loaded everything from my portable hard drive with no problems, so I could get to work quickly.Read full review... I was looking for a new macbook pro after my 2011 macbook pro logic board failed we all know about thoes. Got this baby a huge improvement in every way possible over the 2011, unit arrived in amazing condition not a mark or scratch on it . In third party stores these still retail upwards of $1600  Best purchased made since my 09 mac pro towerRead full review... have had lots of trouble with it shutting down and rebooting.   am thankful that it was still under warranty.  it is now at apple for repair.  love the laptop if it was reliable.   suspect that problem is software.Read full review... In excellent shape, a few scrapes notwithstanding, and so far performing admirably. Awesome computer. Been using it daily for 2 months without any issues. Like new with the most updated operating system. Only clue this is a refurbished computer was a small ding on the bottom of case. Well worth the price.Read full review... Awesome. Definitely saved money with and it looks brand new. It has about little over 400 cycles battery life. It is amazing thank you Was a little skeptical about what to expect. Packaging was up to standard, and arrived well ahead of schedule. Laptop's functioning well and I don't have any regrets with my purchase. Very responsive. Handles everything that I need it to do. Sheâ€™s a beaut, Clark !  ............... Nice mac Everything works fine! Seems legit! Took a little long to get it. However once received, I was satisfied with the quality of this Mac! Nice.

I was extremely happy with the product I bought this product because it was cheaper than i could get it from apple MacBook Pros are the best computers money can buy love it. nice good Excelente producto, mis expectativas no eran altas ya que en ciertas cosas la descripciÃ³n mencionaba que tenia detalles (buscaba que se viera lo mas nueva posible), sin embargo al revisarla y ver lo que venia en la caja, me lleve la sorpresa que el producto parecÃ­a completamente nuevo, muy cuidado y en perfectas condiciones, muy pocos detalles estÃ©ticos y ningÃºn detalle funcional. Este es mi segunda Mac que compro con el vendedor y en lo personal ambas han llegado en perfectas condiciones.

Verified purchase:Â  Yes | Condition:Â pre-owned | Sold by:Â cubbie036 Verified purchase:Â  Yes | Condition:Â pre-owned | Sold by:Â brseller2019 works great This Mac Book Pro is very nice and does everything it is suppose to do. However, changing your HDD for a one TB. SSD, adding 16 gb of RAM, and my little 13\" 2012, Mac Book pro, did not have the touch bar and the fanciness of this unit, but was just about as fast. So we have a difficult to justify price for such 16 laptop. If you want a very good machine and money is no problem, by all mean, go for it. I did, I am just not sure it was the right decision?Read full review... Seems like a great PC except this store I purchased it from won't send me a wall charger to charge the battery.I've contacted them 3 times and they sent me another cord but still nothing that plugs into the wall to charge the laptop.I've had this laptop for almost 3 weeks now and the battery is dead & I have no way to charge it.This is my first Apple product. I decided to get away from Microsoft and it hasn't gone wellRead full review... I love my new MacBook Pro 16\". Computer is plenty fast, but I love the beautiful display and great sound system. I use a Dell 17\" and it does not hold a candle to the Mac for display, speakers, ease-of-use, but most of all portability. The Mac is far lighter and the power brick is a quarter the weight. I love to travel with the 16\" Mac.Read full review... Like  brand new. Original box and accessories. Apple box marked DOD Apple. Printer â€œchipped screenâ€ but I donâ€™t see it. So happy with the price abs quality. I've been using the computer for about three weeks now, and everything works perfect. Very low battery cycle count. I'd say great conditions. I'll be on track, if anything 100% worth the purchase. I was a little skeptical at first because of the open box but itâ€™s basically a brand new macbook for about a $800 discount. Could not be anymore pleased with it. I never leave reviews I just had to with this cause itâ€™s such a great deal with literally no imperfectionsRead full review... The machine works, just wish the warranty info is more upfront (maybe it is just me mis-reading it).and battery count was a little high for a out-of-box.This thing sells at 2000, so I guess that's what those 150$ savings for.Read full review... bought 2 map 16 inches. both came in original packaging with original charging and documents. both came in great shape. very satisfied. Exactly as described, brand new computer- love it. It's a Mac, what can I say? It's fast! SInce I have been using a Mac for so many years, there are no complaints! Sent back my 13 because I wanted the 16 3 cycles and the OG box this thing is amazingly awesome 4 months later it's fantastic worth the 1,700 WOW! This is an awesome Apple PC, it does everything well especially if you have an iPhone or iWatch, it works with all of the other apple products seamlessly! The item came in very good quality. battery count was 2. almost like new Itâ€™s an excellent product. The cream of the crop of apple products, which is saying a lot. very nice machine... No scratches fast MacBook almost new but $700 cheaper It looks like a Super Brand New. low cycle count Everything was good. Everything I want in a computer Exactly what I wanted. Verified purchase:Â  Yes | Condition:Â pre-owned | Sold by:Â peterk1031 super macbook Nothing short of Fantastic!!!I recommend. Amazing computer!! Got this Mac with original box. 0 damage, 0 scratches. Only 17 buttery cycle Very good smart TV woow Better than last year and original macbook air. With the new MacBooks expected some time this fall, this appeared to be a temporary price drop for this machine. I am guessing that, eventually, this price will return for those with patience.The MBP saw its last smaller upgrade a few months ago, but the design itself a few years old by now.  Nonetheless, this MBP does have  a major plus for me over the new versions, purportedly arriving with 4 USB-C ports only:  adapter-free compatibility with everything I need - HDMI, USB 3 and SDXC.  This is important to anyone who has to work with colleagues still using thumb drives, CDs, SD cards and date projectors without Apple TV.Initially, I was slightly concerned about the legitimacy of the product, but it came NIB, all original parts, wrappings with seals intact and the ability to purchase full 3-year AppleCare.Read full review... Apple's 15.4\" MacBook Pro w/Retina Display & ForceTouch Trackpad is a truly redefining piece of unprecedented technology designed and assembled to increase the range, demand, and atmosphere of consumer productivity across all platforms. By transforming the machine itself, Apple presents a durable and promising tool that suits mediums established on professional, personal, and educational levels for an experience harnessed by the computer's multifunctional abilities. Not only does the MacBook Pro exceed traditional options in performance, but also with its stunning power to become singular in the routines of the user. Altogether, Apple's MacBook Pro w/Retina Display sets a new standard in its field, made specifically for every aspect of imagination.Read full review... This computer is absolutely wonderful.  The 2015 MacBook Pros are the best laptops I've seen, including Apple's more recent models.  Super light; sleek; huge, beautiful display; fast; silent; reliable; good autosaving if you let the battery run out; great keyboard and trackpad; nice speakers; still has the ports that are most important to me; doesn't get particularly warm, even with extended use; good OS options. My only complaints so far aren't about the computer itself. 1) The charger it came with burned out within a month and might have been a fake. I solved this with an old charger and the $10 Magsafe 1 to 2 adapter from Apple. 2) Pages is currently a terrible program compared to Word or Apache. But those are just tangential issues, not the computer itself. I love this laptop and will recommend it as the best all around laptop till Apple fixes the butterfly keys and other issues with the new Macs, or another company surpasses it.Read full review... Well, I did not expect it would be as it was shown in the pictures! But this seller just surprised me! I was thrilled when the computer arrived in just 3 days of time and it was in excellent condition. The computer works perfectly! tested the product thoroughly before even installing my old computer's backup into this machine. Drained the battery out and filled back to see how it is! But again, that surprised me too! I meant to say that the battery is in excellent condition. The MacBook Pro Retina display 15inch Mid2015 is $1895 on Amazon and expensive in others that I looked and finally ended up giving it a try on eBay. But this seller has just sold me $1249. Plus, I've got Keyboard cover, snap cover for the machine, also MS Office 2016. And the fact I like about this seller is that he's instantly responsive to your text or message :) I was answered all the questions instantly or no later than an hour. Highly recommended! You don't get such a seller in these day and age on eBay. Note: Don't worry about the scam!! This seller is totally genuine!Read full review... In a time where the cost is more for less this hardware stands out as a good buy.Has all the speed, storage, and memory that most users would ever need. The display is still very crisp and meets or beats a lot of other machines on the market. It has all the ports that I still use and are more than efficient or sufficiently available for media needs without carrying multiple adapters. Light weight enough for everyday carry. (Not many people I know hike 10 miles on foot into work).So yes, a great value in an overpriced economy for machines that barely if at all best the 2015 rMBP.Read full review... At $1,599 could not have received a better value than the 15\" MacBook Pro. There are zero complaints. Move my wife from the Windoze platform that I just \"worked on everyday to keep running\" to a platform that you can really use and get things done, especially with this awesome laptop. Mac is just a pleasure to use. Screen is outstanding, Memory at 16 gb is awesome and the HD is lightning. Bought it before the new one got too small and couldn't use all the great accessories I already have with my 13\" MacBook Pro. If you find it on sale, pull the trigger.Read full review... With the the release of the 2016 Macbook's closing in, it's a good time to buy last year's models because they're dropping in price. I use this machine for Web Dev and I love it. The 15.4 inch screen real estate is awesome and allows me to have many things going on at once. Also the retina display is fantastic. I'm overall really pleased with this device. I recommend this to any developer or average consumer, it's a very nice machine. Read full review... I bought this to replace my aging 2011 Macbook Pro. Just about everything has been improved - it's lighter, sleeker, has USB 3 ports, has a Retina display, better colors, better sound, MUCH faster PCI based storage. Definitely a huge improvement if you have an older Macbook Pro, and the last model before Apple replaced all the ports with lightning ports, removed the MagSafe adapter, and removed the SD card reader. If you're upgrading from an older model, THIS is definitely the model to get at this time.Read full review... First off, this MacBook is upgradable to MacOs Catalina (the current version as of this review). It's very fast, tons of memory, great battery life, looks great.It can easily run Photoshop, Chrome, Excel, Slack, and a few other things at the same time. Perfect for my job as a marketer.Read full review... This is simply the best notebook there is. I'm a long time ThinkPad fan, had several models, but when Apple debuted the first Unibody MacBook Pro, I had to make the switch. Since then, Apple has been on the crown.Apple does not make these without SSDs - so every single MacBook is FAST. Always easily outperforms 95% of all Windows Laptops simply because of the usage of a SSD. People think they need a faster CPU to browse the web - none sense. Most people don't use fast CPUs. This Laptop has performance where it matters the most.The weight and battery life are outstanding and industry leading. They are very thin. They are seamless, no competitor is able to produce a clean chassis like this one. The brand is instantly recognized every on the planet.Let's face the truth, if you sit down with a Dell or HP in a Starbucks, you look like you're a worker bee, putting in extra hours on the weekend. These devices have no sex in them. The MacBook Pro is the laptop that everybody desires. You know it.Read full review... Its a mid to high end laptop from the apple lineup and not everyone may want to pay the premium for it.Very fast and responsive. The 15.6 inch retina display and force touch features are great. Its a much better experience programming in XCode on this configuration compared to the 13 inch screens.Read full review... Great laptop! Yes itâ€™s from 2015 but donâ€™t let that stop you. This thing is fast, light for its size, has all the ports you need built in so you donâ€™t need an adaptor. It comes in very good condition, mine only had the most minor scuffs on the bottom and a tiny dent that is only visible under perfect lighting. It even handles video editing and video games nicely. Overall, for the price Iâ€™m thrilled with this laptop and I would buy it again.Read full review... Powerful and efficient Mac Pro and provides me with everything I needed. I am glad I ran across this deal while browsing instead of going with the new Mac's. Prefer ports and old keyboard to the new additions at this point.Read full review... Solid computer.  Yes itâ€™s a 2015 but this has everything I want. Mag power cord, quad core processor, 16 gb RAM and 512 fb storage. Added bonus was the MacBook case, keyboard cover and windows off.>Very response and shipped very fast.Read full review... The 2015 in my opinion is the best deal on a 15â€ MB Pro at present. Fast, brilliant retina display, sweet form factor. Even five years later the machine is totally current.Absolutely love this purchaseRead full review... After fighting with Windows from 3.1 to Win 10, I was tired of all the problems. When my Win 10 PC kept crashing I decided it was time for a change. I bought this laptop , my first Mac and have never regretted that decision. They are a bit more costly than a PC because they are worth it! I have had ZERO problems with this Macbook. Startup is instant and I never have to reboot! Need a new laptop, go for a mac!Read full review... I decided to make the switch to Mac OS after my Windows laptop died and this Apple MacBook Pro fits the bill. It's lightweight, very powerful and is surprisingly easy to use. I've never used Mac OS and there is a bit of a learning curve, but once you get the hang of where things and how to navigate it's quite simple to use. Love the snappy backlit keyboard and I'm banking on that Apple dependability for many years to come. Highly recommend for anyone on the fenceRead full review... I'm very happy with the purchase. The Macbook is just like new, still under manufacturer warranty. I saved at least $500 compare to buying a new one. Plus, the Macbook is loaded with so many valuable softwares worth more than $1.000.  Delivered as stated. The merchant is very trustworthy. Thank you.Read full review... This MacBook was delivered as promised. Itâ€™s in great shape and it works great. Best price for this MacBook I could find and it came with a brand new battery. Delivered on time even though the battery replacement was delayed. Thanks!Read full review... This was one of the biggest purchases I have ever made, so I was very hesitant. I've been needing a good laptop for college coming up as well as needing it to edit my photos. I wanted to get a good quality one with good storage and a larger screen. For everything I wanted, new it would've been around $2,000+. This is a pretty decent price for all that it is I would say. The shipping was so fast! It came in three days - a week early. And the quality is pretty dang good. Barely any scuffs noticeable. I love it!Read full review... My Macbook came with very few scratches, screen is almost perfect and it works like brand new! Definitely a good buy and better than expected Despite being a few years old, this computer still has plenty of power and battery for the vast majority of people. It works perfectly for my needs. Although it may not give the best bang for the buck value as compared to windows laptops in terms of immediate components, Apple has created a device that is optimized to do what it is meant to do, and what it does do, it does better than anything that windows can offer. It may be pricy, but in my mind, I find that it is worth it if you know what you want and what you'll be getting from an Apple computer.Read full review... This year model is the one I chose because it still had the features that complement my other Mac connections.  The refurbished MacPro was in very good condition and I just needed reorientation on how to go about setting it up especially using the VocMac guide tour.Read full review... For any price under $1600 it is a steal! The performance is great and the quality is top notch. With the new Mac Books set to be release in late October grabbing a heavily discounted older model is a great alternative! If your lucky enough to still be eligible for Apple care protection I would also invest in that too. Extending your warranty for three more years for support in case of any issues.  *Side note* The new Mac books may not even have the standard USB ports and HDMI port. Rumor has it they are set to be released with USB C which could add extras fees for people who need to purchase adapters and such.Read full review... Very powerfull, fast, battery is very good, Retina Display is fantastic. Came earlier than expected which was great and functions how it should and looks brand new I got a 2015 MacBook Pro 15 inch from Quality Macs and everything was as described! Best quality I saw on eBay! Will buy again from Quality Macs when needed! This MacPro 15\" Retina Display laptop is beautiful!  The ease of use is excellent. In my personal opinion, the 2015 MacBook Pro is one of the best laptops you can get, (without spending a million bucks).Bout this one used but just like the description said, it was like new, minus the small delamination on the screen. I definitely would buy again and again from here.Read full review... Although I can't recommend it to just anybody or everybody , it is design for people hwo do a more proffisional work. It is fun to work with but one should know how to work with it.Al the way around a good safe computer to own .Read full review... I couldn't wait to get this, my first Apple MacBook Pro. I got it in about 5 business days, safe and sound. Vender got it off to me same day I purchased it. Fantastic machine. It's price was good compared to all those I looked at and i'm so glad I decided on this selection.Read full review... Great machine.  I just switched from Windows and I'm absolutely loving it.This machine is fast, easy to use, and everything I connect or install works flawlessly the first time without all the \"fiddling\" and \"configuring\" required in Windows.Read full review... Excellent display,  surprisingly good sound quality,  and  just darn fast. Never owned an Apple computer only HP.   Huge difference in quality and worth every penny.  I love that the iPhone and Mac work together.  I am now a proud Apple owner for life. Find an updated/refurbished one for a good price, and you can't go wrong. This laptop will no doubt last me a number of years. Like most people, the new Macs are not within budget, so this was a good option. I am very happy with my purchase.Read full review... I purchased a used MacBook 15\" from a previous owner. It looks and operates like new, and I was able to purchase within my budget. The newest MacBook is pricy, but this was a good alternative. I'm looking forward to many years of good use from this computer.Read full review... For a non-game specific computer, you canâ€™t do better that this version of the MacBook Pro.  Stellar graphics, rapid response and amazing integration are just some of what awaits you.  With this, you donâ€™t have to have an adapter for your other peripherals.  Plus they donâ€™t come with a 4000$ price tag.Read full review... The MacBook looked brand new and battery only had 1 cycle on it.  Great purchase! For any graphic designer this is truly a \"must have\" the display is gorgeous and the laptop is lightweight! Great shape; barely noticable scratches on the exterior. Better value than newer models in my opinion; it has all of the ports you need, good display, and has the memory and storage of some models that go for over $2,000.Read full review...

Verified purchase:Â  Yes | Condition:Â pre-owned | Sold by:Â cellelectronix sunken and collide on body No response I bought the computer and it only served for 2 months Perfect !!! Excellent, thank you! This is the fastest macbook pro ever it handles my pro audio Apollo x and Antelope music interface perfectly  it  blast through my video software with fast renders and timeline video imports. I highly recommend this it's definitely worth the money IF YOUR A professional music producer and videographer and need the power. You can always add an external gpu if you need more power when you're doing high definition videos, but that another story capabilities are endless with the thunderbolt 3 bandwidt. The only con is you can't upgrade the RAM  and video card , so far so good for me. I hope this helpsRead full review... The laptop is from \"open box\" and works great.  I love the amount of storage space and the feature to prolong battery life. Pros:All updates, albeit not that prominent, on this macbook 16 are meaningful. For example,  the return of \"magic keyboard\", the pysical \"ESC\" button and fingerprint button indicate that Apple does take the feedbacks and comments from its customer seriously. And the update for the screen conveys a great sense of aesthetics.Cons:The improvement for speakers are not as good as expected.The video camera is still 720p, the longest last legacy device used on MacBook  (is it that hard to update to 1080p?)Read full review... My unit came super clean, looked brand new. I use it for music production. Runs my Universal Audio hardware and software flawlessly. i9 8 core intel processor with 1TB SSD. Massive improvement. Great value for money and pride to own one. Love it. Love the touchbar. The dictating capability. Iâ€™m a huge fan. Came real fast and since it was an open box, I was expecting some signs of use but it was impeccable! No problems, and a very low cycle count. It even came in within two days! Iâ€™m very satisfied. this is a new laptop for a fraction of the price. Very satisfied customer here!! The best MacBook and a laptop in general that is available on the market. Received in less than 36 hours from purchase! Under promise and over deliver! Perfect!  Thank you!! Good item, as described This macbook was sealed and brand new. Great value and saved some money. I recommend this to people who our looking for a 16inch macbook pro! Love it well conditioned incredible fastest ever Great product,  works well and they delivered. Verified purchase:Â  Yes | Condition:Â pre-owned | Sold by:Â itsworthmore Great machine for all the heavy processing. THIS IS A SCAM. HE TOOK MY MONEY AND SENT ME A PICTURE FRAME . WHAT A LOSER. Nice upgrade from my previous MacBook Pro Oh my gawd. It is so nice! !good deal The laptop is excellent for anyone looking for something that is strong, quick and very dependable.Watching movies on this screen is incredible, 13\" weighs way less than a 15\" and easy to hold and move around.I put a cheap black cover for it and it looks awesome.I used it for low GPU gaming and worked great.I highly recommend buying an SSD and 8GB of memory or more, then you are set.Read full review... I am deeply disappointed in the battery life of this laptop. It is said by the seller that the battery is new and will last for 7hours but this battery doesn't last for even 2 hours when in minimal use! And wen being used 1 hour and about 10mins to be exact. Then when it needs to charged  it takes forever to charge like a good 10 hours smhRead full review... The new 13-inch Apple MacBook Pro brings a lot of new features to the table from the previous generation. Users now get a large battery that gives pretty amazing life, a better display, faster processor, FireWire, SD-card slot, and best of all a lower starting price. Getting more for less seems to be the trend during this slow economy, so is there any reason not to buy the new 13\" MacBook Pro?Build and DesignThe 13.3\" MacBook Pro is very sleek and classy, which is what we have come to expect from Apple. The design is sharp with the unibody chassis showing no panel lines or breaks except on the bottom for the huge panel that covers the internals. Apple gives us a very simple interface with little clutter (and ports) turning what is usually a mindless appliance into a work of art. To further simplify the design they switched to an internal battery for this model, instead of having a cover and release bar like in the previous revision.MSRP: $1,199PROS:-Excellent battery life-Great build quality-SD-card slot!CONS:-This notebook gets hot!-Good looks, poor ergonomics-Slow hard drive13-inch Apple MacBook Pro Specifications:-Mac OS X v10.5.7 (9J3032)-Intel Core 2 Duo P8400 2.26GHz (3MB L2 cache, 1066MHz -frontside bus)-2GB 1067MHz DDR3 SDRAM-160GB 5400rpm SATA hard disk drive-13.3\" glossy widescreen TFT LED backlit display (1280 x 800)-NVIDIA GeForce 9400M graphics (256MB of DDR3 shared memory)-8x slot-loading SuperDrive (DVDÂ±R DL/DVDÂ±RW/CD-RW)-iSight webcam-AirPort Extreme WiFi (IEEE 802.11a/b/g/n)-Bluetooth 2.1 + EDR (Enhanced Data Rate)-Mini DisplayPort, Ethernet, two USB 2.0 ports (480Mbps), -----FireWire 800, Audio out and microphone in, SD-Card reader-Dimensions : 0.95\" x 12.78\" x 8.94\" (H x W x D)-Weight: 4.51 pounds (A bit on the heavy side)-Integrated 58-watt-hour lithium-polymer battery-60W MagSafe power adapter with cable management systemRead full review... I was afraid to get the laptop at first but it works better than I expected. Their is only one dent on the corner and itâ€™s not anything too drastic. The screen works fine too and it charges well. The only problem is I wasnâ€™t expecting to have a Spanish keyboard but itâ€™s not that different. Also my sound may stop working occasionally but itâ€™s rare. It doesnâ€™t take pictures either! Camera still works but no pictures. Luckily I only need mine for typing and work. Besides the keyboard and the sound everything else is great.Read full review... I love this Mac! It has the perfect amount of hard drive space! I love it because it has enough space to be a great Mac as well as space to left over to run Windows which I use for when Mac won't run a Windows application. I did upgrade the RAM as I notice it lag just a little bit and now it runs very smooth.Came with lots of extra applications above the stock ones which was nice as well!Read full review... I received mine with a couple decent scratches on the lid (expected) and a faint dark spot in the middle of the screen thatâ€™s apparent on a light background but other that, Iâ€™m satisfied.  Everything works great and the inside surface is very clean.  I plan to upgrade to an SSD, 8GB of RAM and a new battery and with that my total investment is still under $500....good luck finding a better laptop with similar performance at that price.Read full review... I ordered this laptop Feb 26, it was shipped Feb 27th and it was delivered a few hours ago today! It came in a discreet box and was well protected inside. Power chord was included. There were a few scratches and dents but not anything major. Iâ€™ve only been using it for a few hours and Iâ€™ve noticed the MacBook gets really hot, but other than that it works perfectly fine and I will definitely be a return customer! Only rated it 4/5 because I havenâ€™t had it long enough to give it 5/5. But so far Iâ€™m very pleased with my purchase.Read full review... My concerns at downsizing to a 13 inch lap top have been erased as I find the weight and size more convenient for every day use without any negatives in practical use.As a musician, I use my MacBook for live recording and for composition and find the battery life to be fine.The speed is amazing and Apple's Garage Band, I Movie and I DVD make production a joy.There's no doubt that the initial outlay of money is high, but the ease of use, and the elegance of the operating system make this a great value.Read full review... I gave this to my niece after her Macbook died, and she is enchanted (it has more features and greater power than her first one).  I may even buy one for myself, although I like my desktop Mac. great price, fast delivery, love computer and good purchasing experience. Computer does everything that my business requires and is much more affordable than newer mac laptops. Macs just rock, anyone purchasing computer for first time be it retired folks or younger students this is the computer for you. Easy to learn operation and super fun to play with. These computers are fast and user friendly. The storage space is huge if compared to file cabinets and should last for years. Personally, I have never had a problem with Mac breakdowns. I just purchased this model and it is the 5th mack i have bought over the last 5 years. One for each member of my family. We all love them. Really happy with mine.Rich PiperSupervisorSmall Business OwnerTeacherMechanicRead full review... Its hard to get anything shipped to Alaska from the lower 48, especially with free shipping! So far, the machine looks and operates great! The only problem I have with it is some of the keys donâ€™t want to respond unless I peck the keys hard a few times. The number 2 key, w e, s, and d , are the main problem keys. Other than that, Iâ€™m very happy with my purchase! Thank you!Read full review... i've always used windows, so i am having a little trouble getting used to mac.  not having a right/left click button was odd at first.  it doesn't close sites after i close, but maybe that is just safari.  it opens way faster than what i am used to.  speed is great.  has alot of nice features.  i like the magnetic plug for the charger too. main reason i bought it was b/c mac is supposed to be alot safer.Read full review... Considering it is a late 2011 MacBook Pro it has very good specs. Decent amount of hard drive space for a mix of creative projects and customary work or school use. Enjoy having the versatility of going back and forth between both spectrums. A few minor dents but it is well worth it for the price. Would definitely consider my next purchase from this sourceRead full review... I have been using this computer for over a month now and i have not had any problems with it so far. First impression i thought it had a little more cosmetic damage then i was expecting such as dents and overall fragilness. However, performance wise i have not had any issues and the computer continues to work great. I have downloaded the latest apple OS mavericks as well as the latest versions of iTunes without any problems. The battery life is not the best but i keep mine plugged in for the most part.overall this is a good deal and would recommend to somebody who wants a cheap mack but does not plan on carrying it with them everywhere they go.Read full review... Given its year of manufacture, it couldn't have been better.Its weight, size, speed, design are simply amazing.  Besides, that this product is not prone to viruses as the pcs I have used before,excites me.  For once I can have some peace of mind in the knowledge that my data is safe. I love my mac book pro:It's a great product.Read full review... My friend received his bank in 2017 and I was amazed by how nice it looked and how smoothed it ran, so when my computer started acting up, i decided to trust in tek and it was a great decision!!! Awesome product (I mean of course, itâ€™s a Mac), ships quickly and I feel satisfied because of the warranty as well!!! Go tekRead full review... I've only had my MacBook Pro for almost two weeks now, but so far I love it! I was afraid of opening it to many scratches, marks, etc., but have found little to none. Internally, I have found absolutely no problems (plan to come back if I get any). It is very fast and like new. Great battery life which I particularly appreciate. I am very happy with my purchase, especially at the price, as I have wanted a MacBook for a while and needed a new laptop for my college work-- this has so far proved to be perfect for me. I also decided to get the two-year warranty offered to me after purchase. None of my friends believe the deal that I got, and I still don't.Read full review... This model works wonderful. I love that it still has a disc drive. Quick and supports the newest iOS software. Great purchase! Wasnâ€™t sure what to expect. Itâ€™s a factory refurbished 2011 mac book pro. Some of he reviews on here arenâ€™t great but most of them are accurate.Took 4 business days for it to arrive. Got the mac book and a charger. Some small scratches on the bottom, small dent on the cover - insignificant. The screen and keyboard were great condition.When you start it up, itâ€™ll be restored to its original settings which really date this laptop. However after all the updates, you wouldnâ€™t even know what year the model is, itâ€™s a very solid laptop. For the money, you really canâ€™t beat it.Read full review... This used Mac Book Pro is working out great as a shared computer for my family!  Runs like it's brand new! It's pricey, but well worth the investment if you're going to be using it everyday. I've had mine for over two years and haven't ever had a problem with the hardware or software.Plus, it holds it's retail value extremely well according to priceonomics.com:http://priceonomics.com/computers/apple/macbook-pro-13-2011/Read full review... fast , nice looking computer thats fast enough for anything you need to do. also really fast shipping A PC just can't top a mac. switched from pc a few years ago and will NEVER go back. After all the virus's, blue screen's of death and general clutter of windows OS's. It was refreshing to see someone builds a computer and OS that are truly meant for each other and work in harmony. I spend more time getting more work done or enjoying my music and movies, and less time fixing and rebooting.Read full review... Great Item. Straight out of the box. Ready to go. I took my old macbook and connected to this computer via ethernet cable and transferred the entire computer( programs, settings,etc) to new computer. I am so happy. Basically my old computer in a new macbook pro shell. DJ'd a wedding last night with it and it was flawless. Thanks and I recommend this product to anyone.Read full review... This is a great working tool. I am sure to get years of service from it. Thank YOU! The computer works great and the only flaw is that the battery dosen't last very long. good value. clean product, just a few minor scratches on body, good screen reasonable delivery time The laptop I got is very very clean & it works great besides a random clicking sound every once in awhile. Overall I do love it. The MacBook Pro was working fine one day and the next day it shut down and when I turned it on it got stuck on a white screen with an error sign on it and I didnâ€™t know what to do Iâ€™m waiting on I get it fixedRead full review... Really enjoy using this laptop. I am not one to need all the bells and whistles, but it's great for my music and photo apps. Really quick and doesn't ever leave me feeling frustrated like other computers and laptops I have owned. I am looking into getting a Macbook Air and I can only hope that it will work as lovely as this laptop.I recommend for someone who wants a practical and easy computer but still with the efficiency and graphic capability as some more expensive styles.Read full review... The computer has obvious where and tear on body, as expected, but works great, itâ€™s worth the value, thank you all I can say is they are Bulletproof!  not really... but they are the workhorse of many companies.  We have purchased all of ours second hand either from a Mac service center or from Ebay.  All have been awesome machines.  They do everything that we need them to do. VapRZone . com uses all APPLE Products.Read full review... I love it ,it's what i order and I'm very Happy and pleased.. Thankyou very much for keeping your word I recommend you to every one. I have used Macs since 1993 and my last one lasted 8 years before crashing.  I do a lot of video and class work and this little Mac is way faster than my old one.  The only negative is the price.  I could have bought a whole lot bigger laptop for much cheaper, but Mac does video better than anyone and that is why I purchased this one.Read full review... Definitely recommended for college students. Excellent! You won't regret it! I recently bought it to replace my old PC. I'm a first time Mac user and the performance and speed is pretty amazing. For those who are thinking of buying a Mac I would highly recommend it. I use it for school related work but it's really worth the money. The screen is beautiful.Read full review... Verified purchase:Â  Yes | Condition:Â pre-owned | Sold by:Â epicmacs Best thing I have ever bought! It goes super fast and it has so many cool features that even still I am trying to figure it out! The battery life is average I wish I would last longer but it's still very good to me! (:Read full review... I've been a PC user my entire life,i've alwasy wanted to try a MAC but they were always out of my price range, so when I found one for an amazing price I figured I'd go for, plus my PC was acting up(what else is new) I've had the chance to sit down and use it this enitre weekend and i'm pretty sure I haven't put it down yet LOL, if your a PC user and would like to try a MAC I say go for the only thing you have to lose is....... well nothing. :]Read full review... These MacBook's are getting older but they still work very well and still support the newest software. I strongly recommend one of these as opposed to a brand new one if you are just wanting to do simple tasks.Read full review... Bought two of these for my daughters, can barely tell they are refurbished!  Performing great so far. Works perfectly! It is sturdy, decent battery, and great for coding. Great great great great great great great greatness... and 100000000Xs better than the picture I am very happy with my computer. It is everything I wanted and more. Laptop came exactly as described. Itâ€™s in great condition. When I first got this Macbook it had sticky keys and rice inside the parts. I had to open it up and clean the inside. I didn't know how to fix the issue with the keyboard so I was stuck with sticky keys for a few months. Next thing you know, the Macbook stops working and I had to contact the ItsWorthMore for help. I previously tried to do some self troubleshoot but they told me that since I opened the Macbook that my warranty was VOIDED. Then they have the nerve to recommend me to contact Apple for assistance which I did and even Apple couldn't help me because the Macbook was too old. Now I'm stuck with a NON-Functional Macbook with sticky keys!Read full review... Love a MacBook.  It takes a little time to get use to, but have enjoyed the speed this product has. I would now rather use a MacBook over using any other computer. I would not hesitate to buy another refurbished and upgraded macbook. The computer is exactly at advertised. It's like having a brand new laptop. I wanted a slight upgrade from my 15\" early 2008 MacBook Pro. This was the perfect purchase! It's smaller and lighter weight, so easier to handle, plus a bit faster than my previous laptop. This item has convinced me to go with refurbished Apple products from now on - no need to buy new when you can get this quality for half the price!Read full review... Get it ASAP!

Love this laptop, and Apple support is fantastic, helped my switch and backup from last computer. This laptop is fast, small ad light, the speakers are not great, but good considering small laptops. Battery is amazing, almost 9 hours. I bought this for portability and the new processor and I am definitely getting what I payed for. It boots up quick, and always is ready to go. I like it compared to all my friends laptops, it does everything a laptop should, although pricy.Read full review... This Laptop is Excellent! is super fast... and easy to use!  You will not regret... The weight is excellent, I run program such as Solid Works, IGraf, MiniTab... the run really good...I Do recommend this LaptopRead full review... The aesthetics is wonderful. A great product, pleasant to use. However, apple should provide microsoft office with the Macbook. After spending a huge amount, you would expect some daily use applications installed.Read full review... Looks great on the exterior and runs perfect. I will be a repeat customer for sure. Thanks. I bought this Mac to produce and edit music, I think MacBook is the best machine to do it.Its size is ideal to carry it, and it is a very fast and multitask machine.There is only a better machine than a Macbook pro, it is another Macbook Pro with abigger capacity.Read full review... Needed a computer that will get me through college and this seems like the one Thanks! I loved this macbook! And I recommende! It's the best computer that I could achieve in my life. I can make everything with this personal computer! I can listen to musics, watching movies and using the best aplications that I like!it's' handy for things that I can explore and running good.I can improve my searches and skills.Read full review... What I like about Mac is:The design, speed, convenience, ease of working with Mac, performance, long battery life, stability of the operating system. Awesome deal. My daughter loves it thank you!!!!!!! Very Happy with the product, best item I have ever purchased in a long time!!!Switch from Microsoft PC'S to Mac due to work related issues, so far no problems adapting, different mentality to use it properly, no major issues on any other level.  Got to have the right versions for Mac in order to download and not cause any harm......other than that I recommend 100%.Read full review... It is very comfortable but different from other to use. It is hard to use iOS programs. But other everything is good. It is light, comfortable to cary. This was the perfect laptop for my wife and I.

The MacBook Pro having such a FAST processor and memory makes life so much easier. Once you go MAC you will never go BACK. The macbook packaging was Open and not protected one cÃ³rner of the macbook is bent as if the package was thrown away so it came lousy packaging FANTASTIC COMPUTER!! looks brand new except for the scratches that were well shown in the pictures. And the scratches are not even noticeable. Came with all of the programs that it said it came with. all in all it was a great purchase !Read full review... Great computer, very slightly used but works as designed and has excellent processor speed, for everyday use. Great all around computer for travel or home. Product is just as described. Love the small size and weight. The touch bar is cool and I love the touch ID feature for added security. Great display, Battery lasts a full day. Keyboard is very responsive and the laptop is a joy to look at. I was a hp user,I got my son the mac air,and noticed how it flowed,the speed, take getting us to,but I had to have a mac. So satisfyingly Retina!!!I canâ€™t come up with words to justify what an amazingly modern technological marvel it is. Apple is truly in a great place. Their products transfer me to another time and place like there is not even a barrier between the real world and the one I am viewing! Couldnâ€™t be happier with speed and processing power and overall value and pricing and brightness was stunningly gorgeous. This machines technical specifications appeared to have speakers and brightness and other exceptional features far beyond my anticipations and beyond that of any of its predecessors. One quick benchmark test proves its a solid machine. Read full review... Awesome communication, FAST SHIPPING, best value for your dollar with all the additional applications they install for you!! The product came in on time per the ETA given. Everything was pristine, it was shipped with ample bubble wrap padding & some sort of thick shipping paper material. The machine itself didnâ€™t really seem to have any visible wear so far as I can tell when I received it, if you nit pick you see 1 tiny small scratch or dead pixel in the middle of the screen, but again itâ€™s completely negligible for everyday use. The laptop is very lightweight, runs Mac OS like a champ with minor hiccups by the Touch Bar but can easily be fixed by going to sleep mode and waking the machine right back upRead full review... A great product for those who is looking for an upgrade. Nice and sleek. It will take a while to getting used to but nonetheless a loveable computer. This review is one year late but I still use the product and it was as described. Perfect Looks and performs brand new. Thanks again. Beautiful product $1025 for a top of the line, one year old MacBook Pro with very minor cosmetic damage. Literally unbelievable. Fantastic value, I definitely recommend bidding on their products! You blew my mind with that keyboard cover, I was using MacBook and stuffs would stuck on the keyboard and make it hard to press but with this nothing like that could happen. Thanks appreciate it. Looks brand new and zero issues very satisfied thank you its compact with many port for charging i loved the type-C charger and the idea of making all ports the same, the only bad thing is the keyboard it doesn't feel like mac. i thought that this was 15\" size Wonderful product for a great value.  I love my new MacBook Pro The pictures were exactly what I got, great for the price The best condition ever!!! Not a single scratch I received the product very fast. My son has no complaints and seems to be ready for school Monday Great product and great value people might think it's pricey but you get what you pay for honestly reccomend this great features, easy to use, good quality. Very pleased with this laptop. Already using it and its wonderful. Great doing business with you! MacBook Pro. What else can be said. Matches very well with the nickname DongleBook. Have bought 4 products from these guys over the past couple of months and they never disappoint! I bought the MacBook Pro 2016 brand new in box. Nothing against the performance, however after I set it up I felt the Macbook is not complete. I could not use my mouse or transfer my pictures right away from the box. Because it did not have the ports I needed. Apple advertises once and you can start using the Laptop after u opened the box. At least if you pay $1500, than they should provide the necessary adapter to get going right away. Read full review... Exactly how I expected it to be. Still works perfectly. I love my new MacBook, itâ€™s perfect. They cancelled on me and funds will be in holding while they refund full. Can't buy another one because of this.  Bestbuy scam to people to look at their items.

This macbook pro is perfect  !! Love it! Feels amazing and works great!! Great This laptop is great. I love the power and speed of it. This laptop connects to the internet, bluetooth, location, you name it and it does it fast. This laptop has a quick 2.80GHz Intel Core i7 processor which is a great processor but gets really hot at times, especially if you are using an aluminum unibody macbook pro. I love the size of the screen and how bright it is. This laptop is big and wouldn't be the best for someone who takes it everywhere but I use it mainly at home and it works great!Read full review... Expensive, but my favorite computer.  Much faster than Windows.  Beautiful bright screen, you'll love it! After fix the logic board an excellent machine reliable and fast love it, it's worth every penny. i bought it for my dad and he loves it and so do i. the only thing i disliked a bit was the size of it. kinda big afterall. but well worth it. Thankyou Very Much! Exellent Condition, I Love It!!Thankyou ! ! love it great condition Great computer for those doing heavy duty graphics or architectural work. The I7 processor is loads faster than the dual cores, and the 17\" screen and beefy graphics card mean it renders things quickly and your eyes won't go bad in the process. Great Computer for anyone needing power, a big screen, and easy portability!Read full review... j'ai pas gagner l'enchere mais on me la colerbought the NewPhone 74205 three weeks ago and was immediately impressed with the number of features available on this inexpensive phone. It has a 1M-pixel camera, video camera, and speakerphone. The NewPhone's size is perfect for carrying in a pocket and the battery has a pretty good lifespan of roughly 4 hours. My only complaint is that the menu system on the phone makes you click four times before you can find someone in the address book, set an alarm, or perform a additional functions. Other phones I've owned have simpler menus and get you to important features easily. Overall, I'd recommend the phone if you're on a budgetRead full review... This bad boy has 3. This is the best macbook pro you can ever buy. super fast. affordable, beautiful screen.The Ram is enough to do anything. the 7200 rpm hard drive and SSD give you performance boost. I love this laptop.Read full review... I've had earlier models of the Macbook Pro 17\" before so I knew what to expect.  I didn't buy a new model from Apple as they had discontinued the 17\" size model. Works well for a kid's remote-learning tool, where a current Macbook or Macbook air would be overkill (and twice as expensive), but still runs MacOS. The screen isn't the highest-resolution retina type, but it's bright and more than enough for worksheets and the like. Speakers are plenty loud for schoolwork. Pretty good battery life, even with  300 cycles already at the time of purchase. Sturdy - survived a tumble down the stairs with a pretty big dent but no loss of functionality as far as I can tell. I don't think this 2017 model air has a T2, so it hopefully will be possible to upgrade the ssd later if needed.Read full review... Just arrived with a huge dent in it after long wait without a computer. Box wasn't very sturdy, no packing slip.. but pristine, so didn't happen in shipping.  A dent this significant at least deserved mention in the item description. No I need to hire a tech to look at it to make sure the connections and everything else is ok. I don't see how a dent this bad didn't damage delicate connection. This was also a very important and very expensive investment for me living on fixed income of about $730/mo, a Covid survivor who is still very sick and has been depending on laptop for shopping, video doctor visits,  paying bills, and so on, so paying for a tech and living with this uncertainty is very troubling. Read full review... This is a 2017 MacBook Air and the quality is great. Not a lot of memory but that can be fixed with an external drive. The screen looks awesome for those people that are working with photo shop or any kind of visual effects. The Mac is very light and at 13.3â€ this laptop in not to big and not to small, itâ€™s just a perfect size. If your looking for a good quality MacBook Air this is the computer for you but remember that this middle doesnâ€™t have a lot of memory and if your working on videos of high quantity of photos, your going to need an external drive.Read full review... I was really hesitant at first buying a MacBook on eBay. Especially one that claims to be unopened NIB etc. but I got the package and it was wrapped with care, and the box still had itâ€™s plastic on it! Great value and excellent customer service! So far so good with the laptop! Thanks !Read full review... Apple Mac Air laptop 13 \" for our Grand daughters first year university. She opened the box, turned it on opened the program and followed the process of loading your info as noted in steps. First she indicted how fast it worked and loaded and how easy to transfer all her old Mac data in to it. Let's put it this way is a great light weight fast computer.Read full review... I just got it today, everything looks brand new & great to me. It came in the original packaging, sealed with the plastic & all. I will write an update if anything changes. This MacBook Air is very light and easy to carry around with me. I use it at home most of the time and it doesn't weigh me down. It's powerful enough to use it as a office laptop or to play games from Apple Acarde. I recommend this MacBook to first time computer users or switching from Windows to macOS. Thank you.ðŸ˜ƒðŸ˜ƒðŸ˜ƒðŸ˜ƒðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜ŠRead full review... Best value for money, not just from apple, but compared to any existing laptop out there. Light, amazing battery life, great durability and impressive performance!long version:I've been using the Air series for the past 6 years (so has my wife) and i have to say that there are only words of praise! It is extremely reliable, very good battery and very lightweight.I use it mainly for business which involves a lot of coding, but i often use image and video editors and it never felt lagging. And this is while having on average 60 browser tabs opened almost constantly!I recommend you to buy it if you're a student, freelancer, traveling or moving around a lot. Here are some useful tips that might save you plenty of headache:- the retail price is around 1000$ and depending on the model goes higher. But from my experience, you should be able to get a deal of 750$ at least once in 2 months, so don't rush throwing away the cash!- pay attention to sweaty palms (they may leave a permanent whitish stain), wearing metal armbands/watches and cufflinks (may scratch the thin side).- the most fragile element of all is the power cord. Make sure you don't wrap the cord very tightly when transporting it;- the biggest enemy of the battery seems to be Chrome. I can normally use it with 60 tabs for 4-5 hours, but i heard others getting way more time if using safari, so keep that in mind.Read full review... I definitely recommend this product! It looks like it is brand new out of the box! It just had one minor scratch at the bottom of the laptop. Works and looks perfect otherwise. Won't be buying brand new ever again. :)Read full review... Very nice computer,and newer model. Like new condition. Recommend! Grandson loves it. Great computer. My grandson wanted this for his first year of college and loves it. Great price thanks I am really impressed on how good this machine performs. Had a windows laptop before with a I7 quad core processor and this MacBook Air just destroys my old laptop. It is thin and portable. Highly recommended.Read full review... It's a great fit for me as a college student! It's light and small and easy to carry around in my backpack all over campus, but it's also big enough for everything that I use it for! It took a while for me to adjust to a MacBook as its my first one and I still don't quite know how to use everything, but the quality of the computer is great! For the amount of money I spent it on so far it has been worth it.Read full review... I wasnâ€™t sure about how I felt when ordering the laptop not that I have it itâ€™s exactly as described unopened brand new and I love it. I decided to treat myself to a new laptop. What I wanted to spend wouldnâ€™t get me what I wanted. So on Cyber Monday I went shopping. I found my new laptop here at several hundred dollars below everywhere else I looked. It was delivered today and itâ€™s made me a happy man. Thanks for a great product at a great price. Happy Holidays!!Read full review... We bought for a Christmas present for our Grandson. Since he is a Senior this year, we gave it to him early. He LOVES it. Thank You so much I purchased this MacBook for my special needs sister.  I wanted something that was easy to use but lightweight.  I have a larger MacBook so I knew she would be to use this without any problems.  This MacBook is great.  The only problem I had setting it up was she didn't have an apple account.  Once I set that up, setting the MacBook up was a breeze. I purchased this on sale in November and got a great deal, but it is a great deal at regular price.  It easily syncs with other devices, including her Ipod.  The product arrived quickly and in excellent condition.  Very happy with the purchase.Read full review... After 9yrs with my 1st MacBook, it was time for an upgrade. This MacBook Air did not disappoint. Fast and works flawlessly. My only minor gripe would be that the metal edges of the laptop's body is a bit sharp and tends to dig into the skin. An after market plastic case remedied the issue, but for the price of these laptops, Apple should smooth out the edges. With that said, I absolutely love this laptop, and hopes it holds out just as long as my first one.Read full review... I am always skeptical to buy anything of this value from eBay, but upon receiving this item, it does seem to be brand new and in good working order. Got my computer today, honestly was a little bit skeptical because this was such a good deal. Everything came as pictured, Mac was in a Apple factory sealed box, brand new.  Everything works great, very happy with this new Macbook Air.Read full review... Bought for my niece as a gift for going to university. She loves it as it's light as easy for her to carry in her backpack and it's work great for the works she needed in university. I agree with all the five star reviews! It's a great machine, with amazing battery life. The track pad is sensitive, and this is the first laptop I've had with which I didn't feel the need for a mouse: it's light, responsive and accurate.Now the only \"but\". When I bought it two years ago, I didn't care about the lack of HD camera. But now I do. This is my only reservation about this little wonder machine. Still, I looked at the price on today's ad, and thought \"Maybe I should get the newer model and sell mine ...\". It's still the best computer I've ever owned.Read full review... Perfect condition just like pic. The Mac air arrived early. The laptop works great no issues no blemishes was brand new as advertised. I just live it so much and for such a good price too Although used, it arrived in great condition.  It has plenty of power and memory for everyday computing plus it just works!  No weird issues that plague my Windows computer. I found that setting up was fast and easy. Itâ€™s light weight and it looks great. Hopefully it last a longtime. Arrived earlier than expected great battery and nice size screen Great product for the price and being Apple because sometimes Apple can be too expensive. It does a good amount of things for a student, maybe not for a person who needs more features for photography or design but it is great for a student high school and up. Overall, very convenient weight and will last a good amount of years until you need a new laptop.Read full review... I LOVE this laptop, itâ€™s exactlt how it was described, the ONLY thing is it does die kinda fast which is annoying, but I donâ€™t know if thatâ€™s just how Macs are because Iâ€™ve only had a Mac desktop outside of this. But other than that I love it, I take it everywhere with me.Read full review... My wife loved getting her apple she uses it all the time and it is of good quality  and it works great. Recommend you get it if you can. The computer came in a factory-sealed box.  Works perfectly so far so we're very happy with it and the excellent price. It was also nicely packaged for shipping. There was no signature required, though, and we're glad we happened to be in at the time. We would not have wanted this just left at the door.Read full review... This is the best one I have ever own, absolutely cover new in box, carefully packaged. The price is lower than in store and itâ€™s too match for student I bought this MacBook to upgrade from my 2008 model which was much heavier. Not to mention slower. I purchased it for a very good price and it has helped. me do a much better job in my business. I bought this MacBook Air for my daughter for Christmas and she totally loves it.  She will use it for college and she is very happy with it so far. It's my first experience with an Apple laptop. I am absolutely delighted! Great experience! Absolutely worth the money! Works great, so far so good .... Great product made by Apple..I would recommend this Mac Air very goof value and performance. Bought for daughter for her graduation gift. Looking for a cover and case to go with it by ending may...canâ€™t seem to find any with this model number. This is the first apple laptop product that I have ever owned and if the first few days of using it are any indication I will never be going back.Fast, lightweight, user friendly, just overall a great machine thus far.Read full review... Brand new as described. Works flawlessly. Shipping was a little slow, but laptop worth wait. Great price! I love my new MacBook :) i5 CPU powerful;SSD fast and reliable, 128G little bit small, but everything will store online like google drive. 128G for OS and temp data is enough.iOS much better than Windows 10, Chrome, Linux, etc.Looks so cool!Read full review... I recommend this laptop for anyone who likes mac software and quick, light, portable laptops! Would definitely buy again. Highly recommend!! It's so fast without no lag.  I love it. It's a lot of money but it's better to invest in a great product than paying money fixing the cheap ones Came early than expected, wonderful and safe packaging, all around good purchase. Computer works perfectly. Thanks! Laptop arrived early in amazing condition! Not a single scratch or scuff and screen is perfect. They even included lots of extra cases and screen protectors. This laptop is so fabulous! What a steal! I gave this as a gift to my husband (who has a 10-year old laptop) for Christmas, and he is LOVING it! As we all know, these products are sooo easy to learn/use! He had a pc, so...Hello! Itâ€™s a whole new tech world for him!!Read full review... Its exactly what I expected. My daughter uses it for school since they are now virtual. It handles all her school needs and syncs to her phone which is what we needed. This machine is amazing, and it will last you a long time if you take good care of it. It is definitely worth every penny. Good value and works awesome as my daughter computer for college. Just what she eanted! i wish i wait it  for the price i paid i would gotten Retina  screen but when you rush you get screwed next time take your time never rush Thanks a bunch! My last semester of nursing school will be so much easier now that all my apple products talk to each other! Computer was new in sealed box.  Computer was delivered in three.  Great buy! Great purchase. Needed new computer for my daughter, incoming college freshman. I bought her a HP for Christmas and it mysteriously broke in July. So after 6 months, hp would not repair. Do only Apple for now on. And this computer is fast and smooth and lite.Read full review... Verified purchase:Â  Yes | Condition:Â new | Sold by:Â batzmaruebiz The laptop even arrived early! And it is in mint condition! Works excellent, wouldnâ€™t even know it was used before! MacBook Air came brand new, seller was super communicative and there were many shipping options. Would recommend to anyone and everyone. The laptop came as advertised, fully loaded just needed to upgrade to the newest iOS.Highly recommend. Item was exactly as stated. Looks brand new! A little scratched on the bottom, but other than that works great! Came super fast, which is a plus. Thank you!! The body of these haven't changed at all since the 2013 model. They should've made the 2017 model a retina. All that got upgraded was the memory to 8gb as the standard, and the CPU got a unnoticeable boost to 1.8GHz from 1.6GHz. Honestly, if 4gb ram is sufficient for you, get the 2014 model.Read full review... Very happy with my new computer. It came in a brand new package and it was a great price. I expected a few blemishes and scratches- but this was dented and separating and in Terrible condition. I was excited and hopeful - but this deal is way to good to be true unfortunately :(  I think this computer was used as a football before getting refurbished...Read full review... We Bought this for our 10 year old Son he Loves it Thank You. This is the best laptop I have ever owned. I use it for my college work and I am able to carry it everywhere to access my homework. Itâ€™s light and compact, itâ€™s fast and itâ€™s not as complicated to use.Read full review... On time delivery.Second purchase from de_clutter store.I'm very satisfied with their products and sometimes look to the store first for an item I may be thinking of purchasing. Well worth the money! I can't wait to use it this up-coming semester. (: ABSOLUTELY PERFECT!!! Exactly as described and it was delivered a week earlier than expected.. So happy I made the purchase. THANK YOU!!! I arrived just as the description said!  My daughter loves it. The computer was new in the box and everything works great. Canâ€™t wait to use it for school next semester Older MacBook Pro laptops like this one offer excellent value for anyone who does not need the blazing CPU speeds offered by the new Mac towers and MacBook Pros. If you are seriously considering a new MacBook or MacBook Air, a 2012-2015 MacBook Pro deserves your consideration. If storage capacity is important, Other World Computing (for a few hundred dollars more) can help you out with 1TB or 2TB SSD upgrades.Read full review... excellent condition! very little signs of wear. it's like it is brand new! Love the retina display & USB 3.0. Very light & fast. Better than expected and very happy with Infinity Precision team's responses whenever I had a question. Highly recommend.  I especially love the 3-year warranty hopefully nothing goes south but it's good to have some insurance.Read full review... Excellent condition! No issues with the product. Worked as well as a brand new computer. The most amazing product you can ever invest in. Great design, Apple is just great! The trackpad was not working.

I was hesitant due to the size and weight of the older MacBook Pro's but was very happy when I got my hands on it. It really is a great merger of the older MacBook Pro and MacBook lines. I don't understand the complaints about ports, You have 2 USB-C. I picked up a HooToo Shuttle and a USB-C to DisplayPort cable. I don't need anything else. 1 Drives up to a 5K display, and the other one has 3 USB 3.0 ports, an SD Card Reader and power delivery and also 4K HDMI support. What else do I need, and this makes it so easy to take the Laptop with me and not be encumbered. The keyboard is very nice too.Read full review... I bought the computer for my girlfriend, when it came she went to set it up and a flashing folder with a question Mark came up. We searched google to see what the problem was and we found out that there is an internal problem. Probably needing a new hard drive . . Was told that was ready for new user with the only problem was a space bar. Read full review... Super fast  looks brand new works great Laptop is in great shape! I canâ€™t even tell itâ€™s used!

Super satisfied with my purchase! I love how the keyboard feels in my hand. Itâ€™s definitely my fastest laptop and I really love it. This is a great computer it is really fast and light weight I highly recommend purchasing! Problems with laptop out of box. Have to do hard reset to turn on. Was supposed to be in working order. Jammed keys, glitches in hardware. No camera detected problems unfolding as I use. Too problematic to pay for shipping back 5000 miles.Read full review...

methods and eventually stab a knife to get the screws off GoodApart from the striped screws which may be a major issue if you do not succeed in getting the bottom plate off the machine is in decent shape no battery issues or otherwiseVery minimal cosmetic wear and tearRead full review I wanted to buy a lightweight yet powerful laptop for college and was considering buying a Windows 8 machine until I found this laptop on eBay It is the absolute perfect weight and has that sophisticated style that any college student can appreciate The i5 processor completes any task given to it with ease I enjoy mostly everything about the laptop with the minor exceptions being the battery life and lack of a higher resolution display At a rated 7 hours it is nothing to sneeze at but watching videos and extensive use will shorten the overall time I know the latest generation Intel chips have solved this problem and it is not a fault of the machine itself The screen is bright and vivid although recent full HD 4K even Apples own Retina display best this units 1440 x 900 resolution Compared to other laptops this wins hands down The PCs I considered had sturdy builds but the reputation that Windows 8 has and Apples ability to build great laptops sealed the deal With the few minor gripes I have emphasis on minor this is a great overall laptop and one that I would recommend to anyone Apple built a workhorse of a laptop and one that will be able to take whatever the average user will throw at itRead full review Second purchase from Tek First was an iPad Both items in great shape and work fine Airbook hard to tell from new Why pay twice or 3 times as much I was a Macbook Pro user until I found this little gem Machine is a refurbished unit but looks and performs like new with Mojave OS Wasnt sure about the 4 GB Ram but it works extremely well and does everything asked of it Lightweight design makes it a lot easier to take anywhereDownside is the upgradeability isnt as quick and easy as the old Macbook Pro Memory is soldered into the motherboardRead full review After being a loyal MacBook Pro fan I have finally switched over to the MacBook Air  The newest generation MacBook Air packs a powerful i5i7 that easily outperforms my 2009 266Ghz Intel Dual Core Macbook Pro  The battery life is amazing Im able to get very close to what Apple has quoted and having a Solid State Drive the battery can stay charged for literally weeks when in sleep mode forget about turning this laptop off  The boot times are phenomenal and will surpass any Macbook with a traditional HDD  I love how portable this laptop is its extremely lightweight and much more bag friendly than my 154 MacBook Pro  This laptop is going to be more than perfect for you if you like to browse the web watch videos edit documents or edit pictures  Now if your needing more power for gaming or memory intensive programs such as Adobe Illustrator I would suggest looking into a MacBook  But for most users I believe this laptop will more than fit the everyday users needs  Im confident that this laptop will stay modern and compatible with all Apple software for another 4 or 5 years and Im even more confident that this laptop will hold its value for several years I believe that the Intel i5i7 processors will be here for awhile and over the next few years solid state drives are going to grow even more popularRead full review he 2012 MacBook Air no longer stands as the coolest Mac laptop that crown has been temporarily stolen by the Retina Display MacBook Pro Nor is it as unusual However it still remains the best example of an ultrathin laptop  for its construction quality performance and ergonomicsThe 13inch Air has the same looks as last year and nearly the same build with a few key differences a new thirdgen Intel Core i5 processor USB 30 ports replacing the previous USB 20 a higherdef 720p Webcam and an altered MagSafe 2 charge cable and connector Also both 13inch MacBook Pro models now cost 100 less bringing the entrylevel model with 128GB solidstate drive SSD to 1199 the exact same cost as the 13inch MacBook ProRead full review This MacBook Air Lap top computer has a lot better features than the PCs that are out there  the speed is incredible  Although it didnt come with an internal CDDVD RRW drive it had the usb connections that would support the these external

amazed of how good the battery life is for the things that i want is a perfect fit if you want to do editing or need a lot of hard drive space for HI DEF Movies and stuff maybe this is not a very cost effective option but for mid range to casual user or a college student this is a great choiceOne of the most portable computers out there and a great value if you can get a 2011 or 2012 model with 128Gb for under 1100 go for it Some people complain about not being able to burn a CD since it doesnt have CDDVDRW but theres a lot of options of external drives out there and this might be a factor to consider if you burn a lot of CDs all the timeI dont find myself doing it very often so is not an issue for meNo complains on performance yetRead full review Love how it boots up immediately Everything about it is faster Always wanted to try an SSD and willing to live with the smaller 120GB storage for the faster response and bootup time I keep the drive lean and use an external FW

displayRead full review MacBook came quickly nicely packed and ready to go Iâ€™m happy with it Itâ€™s my first MacBook so I am glad I could find one at a reasonable price I cant believe this is affordable just because it has minor cosmetic damages that arent noticeable The macbook air 2012 i received functioned exactly like a new one I bought this for my mom and even my brothers response Mom has a better laptop then me was priceless Thank you for everything Beautiful product top notch service you get thumbs up from meRead full review Just as advertised great shape everything good battery count was very high but I didnâ€™t ask for it so that was my error still holds charge almost without issues Delivery was made before time and that was good I bought this for my mom and she loves it Thank you Read full review I was hesitant about ordering this a gift for my daughter and after a prior purchase elsewhere  that turns out badly this one was excellent The computer was an excellent quality as described arrived with extremely solid padding to ensure its safety and works perfectly Thank youhighly recommendedRead full review A laptop with 12 hours of battery life a fast SSD and extremely thin and light design for a competitive price This is one of the best computers Apple makes It is easy to carry around has all day battery life and almost matches equally configured Ultrabooks Only gripes are rather slow 13 GHz i5 processor and integrated HD 5000 Graphics which might not be enough for some users But for everybody else it is amazing Best part it boots up in 12 secondsRead full review i am loving my Apple laptopI have more learning to do but it sure is fun I absolutely love it I was so not expecting it to come in two days already Always wanted a MacBook and thanks to you I finally got one at a great price and great quality  Thank you Arrived early in great shape runs well Would purchase again Now my kids want one exactly like it Although this Mac book Air is 4 years old its in like new condition This is my first Mac so Im still getting use to it Bad Untrustworthy Computer has no desktop Reboot does not result in any desktop Just this white screen with blinking manila folder question mark image Will not buy from Steele Merce again I was quite skeptic at first considering Iâ€™ve never bought a laptop online and wow it was the best decision I made For 270 bucks you canâ€™t beat it at all It works perfectly is b condition and is beautiful LOVING ITRead full review Purchased the Apple MacBook Air 13 Intel Core i5 18GHz 4GB 128GB SSD and it is fair and working well for me for my school project kudos to you and i will keep supporting our business Got this for my daughter to go to college with works great and she loves it I purchased this to replace an iPad which was too limited in its functionality This is almost as light and portable but with all of the conveniences of a laptop computer except for the lack of a CDDVD drive which can easily be purchased and connected via USB in the future and ethernet connection if you need wired internet accessI have had several MacBook Pro laptops and this rivals all of them in performance and quality of the sound Also the screen resolution is actually better than the 13 MacBook Pro and has the same resolution as the 15 ModelRead full review HORRIBLE VALUE HORRIBLE WARRANTY Paid for extra warranty and NOTHING was covered  VERY disappointing  Took it in for second opinion and received a totally different answer  NOT RECOMMENDING THESE PEOPLERead full review Although EXPENSIVE compared to similar laptops this one is really great Outstanding performance really fast and great incredible graphics Battery life though could be very short if you use it out of the plug constantly  Besides that this is a really nice laptop with great construction materials and portable very lightRead full review Love the computerworks perfectly A very little dent can hardly see it Runs smoothly Love love it Thanks guys This product is exactly as describedâ€”not a scratch on it And the packaging was smart and secure It even came a day earlyIâ€™m truly happy with my purchase and itâ€™s good know that honest people still exists D Read full review Computer was in great shape order came early and I am in love with my new Mac Thanks and hope to buy from you again in the future my wife loves it Letâ€™s just say you went above and beyond Exactly as described  Showed up USPS in the original box  I really appreciate a good deal for a laptop for my HS daughter whoâ€™s college bound The computer isnâ€™t bad looking itâ€™s slow But my issue is the camera just doesnâ€™t work at all itâ€™s just a blank screen when I go to use it This is awesome product and there was only one dent in the product and the Mac itself ran great you will never find a MacBook this cheap or at this good of quality ever ðŸ’¯ðŸ’¯ if your reading this I recommend you get it while they lastâ€¼ï¸\\x8fRead full review Laptop has good aspect and works very well I went in for a local pickup and the overall transaction process was alright At first I believe they had misplaced my order but then upgraded me at no cost and gave me the same product I had ordered Now yes there are some white pixel spots on the screen which I do not appreciate but then again this is a used computerKeep in mind while buying anything used there will be wear and tear along with scratches scuffs and etcBUT If you are ever in the market for a used Macbook or any mac product BUY HERE THEY ARE VERY GOODRead full review Iâ€™ve had this computer for over a year So far itâ€™s running great Came with some dents but I knew it wasnâ€™t brand new Totally recommend it I was very impressed when I received my MacBook Air Everything works

unit came with very little damage really none  She was able to load all of her information to the computer and now all she needs to do is keep those â€œAâ€™sâ€\\x9d  Read full review The Macbook is a superb laptop as long as your priority is small and light Its monitor is especially good It also comes with 8GB of RAM and 256 GB of solid state hard drive While its certainly not the fastest processor available its the quietest and able to do most jobs other than intense video processing or gaming but then if you had those apps you wouldnt be likely to get one in the first placeThe bottom line is theres very little out there than can match the Macbook in its area of expertise especially if you also have other Apple products and want to coordinate amongst themRead full review Iâ€™ve had this for quite sometime now and forgot to leave a review  Everything was perfect thank you  I love this MacBook Describe as in the picture Macbook 2016 is one of the greatest Apple feature its very

for the daughter in grad school and she love it Can take it to class and is very lightweight Good evening is your macbook operating normally The MacBook was listed as an open box item which had me skeptical but it was basically brand new with only 1 battery cycle Love this MacBook Itâ€™s fast and got everything you need to get the job done Shipping on the item was also amazing arriving on my doorstep in less than 24 hours I highly recommend this computer and the listing You wonâ€™t be disappointedRead full review Great laptop  nice and fast with nothing that has bogged it down so far Touch ID and Touch Bar is nice Only downside is the battery does not last near 10 hours like they quote Id say about 6 hours is normal Read full review Brand new in box top quality product  Better price than other outlets based on same specifications The MacBook Pro was labeled open box and was about 400 off I found no problems with the computer It is new and functions well I was shocked how perfect it came for a used product Would definately recommend The listed price on apple is 1799 and the price was 1349 for an open box It was basically new without any scratches or any signs of wear Also the product came in two days Recommend 1010 Mac is running great and looks awesome I had some doubts because it is open box but came as new Thanks came in perfect cosmetic condition the battery

Verified purchase Yes  Condition Preowned Exactly as described Verified purchase Yes  Condition Preowned Like new I love it thank you I need it for studying and it works beautifully Verified purchase Yes  Condition New Good Product  Great Price Perfect Verified purchase Yes  Condition Preowned I had no idea of how terrific this Macbook Pro really was I had notice an explosive proliferation in this computer so I suspected there really was something special about it I had a MacPro for many years for editing movies and pictures I grew to love the Apple ecosystem and the fact that once you learn how to maneuver in the system It is the way computing should have been all along I had been a pc advocate using different brands like Dell and HP When the Windows 10 OS came out it was the last straw PC laptops I had been buying were so cheaply and shoddily designed that they were finally obsolescent The Macbook Pro is ruggedly built incredibly well designed including the retina display that blows me away every day It comes with the best OS on the planet The battery is long lived and it recharges quickly One major advantage is that this machine is usable as soon as you turn it on and login Not like a pc that is rendered unusable at login or at some arbitrary point you choose to receive updatesThe major items that made this a great buy for me are the followingValue from the Apple ecosystemValue from the great design and rugged constructionValue from high quality audio system for streaming video and enjoying musicValue from the brilliant retina displayValue from the lighted keyboardValue from the well cared for computer by the original ownerBest value of all was the third party software already installed by the previous owner The Microsoft Office for Mac 2011 and CS6 Photoshop ApertureRead full review This MacBook Pro is an absolutely beautiful machine I had issues with my 2011 Mac and so I decided to upgrade to this one three years newer For being only three years newer its night and day different than the 2011 For starters its way lighter and sleeker I really love the feel and look of this model 2014 It is very responsive and the screen its a beautyI wish I had bought one with a bigger hard drive but for the price I paid for this one Ill live with the smaller hard drive If youre on the fence about the 2014 MacBook Pro rest assured that its all that the descriptions says and so much more I will not be uploading pics because I just got it and really dont feel like taking photos of it right now but believe me its really niceRead full review The macbook came clean and very few to unnoticeable minor scratches just on the bottom of the macbook Theres only one problem The problem is that I canâ€™t find one problem wrong with it Itâ€™s pretty fast and no errors Charging cable came brand new with mac os catalina freshly installed Best laptop Iâ€™ve had since my HP elitebook 8770WRead full review Its wonderful Apple MacPro retina speed is superb and very convenient and easy to use Editing and loading photos is 100 hazel free This is the entry level 154 size Mac Pro For developers this is better than the 133 inc with dual core If you plan to do lots of video editing then you may need to up size the RAM to 16 vs 8 Also if you need more storage and RAM go with ME294 vs ME293 But for a developer this is the best valueRead full review If youâ€™re just getting into the world of apple and you want a laptop skip the MacBook Air The sheer performance of the MacBook Pro Retina computers will knock your socks off Thereâ€™s not much you canâ€™t do on these laptops not to mention that the display is absolutely beautiful Overall this is a very good Mac 1010 recommendedRead full review Until Thunderbolt ports are doubled up on EVERYthing I think this is the last great Mac laptop its still has its Firewire ports AND a Thunderbolt port AND 2 USBs and separate sound in and out AND a builtin CDDVD readerwriter Retina for me is

not come with Microsoft office which means additional cost I would recommend the macbook pro but not the retina display one This computer  has everything I need its fast and it has a large clear screen which makes it great for editing photos  It came with the latest software and I loaded everything from my portable hard drive with no problems so I could get to work quicklyRead full review I

my little 13 2012 Mac Book pro did not have the touch bar and the fanciness of this unit but was just about as fast So we have a difficult to justify price for such 16 laptop If you want a very good machine and money is no problem by all mean go for it I did I am just not sure it was the right decisionRead full review Seems like a great PC except this store I purchased it from wont send me a wall charger to charge the batteryIve contacted them 3 times and they sent me another cord but still nothing that plugs into the wall to charge the laptopIve had this laptop for almost 3 weeks now and the battery is dead  I have no way to charge itThis is my first Apple product I decided to get away from Microsoft and it hasnt gone wellRead full review I love my new MacBook Pro 16 Computer is plenty fast but I love the beautiful display and great sound system I use a Dell 17 and it does not hold a candle to the Mac for display speakers easeofuse but most of all portability The Mac is far lighter

Nothing short of FantasticI recommend Amazing computer Got this Mac with original box 0 damage 0 scratches Only 17 buttery cycle Very good smart TV woow Better than last year and original macbook air With the new MacBooks expected some time this fall this appeared to be a temporary price drop for this machine I am guessing that eventually this price will return for those with patienceThe MBP saw its last smaller upgrade a few months ago but the design itself a few years old by now  Nonetheless this MBP does have  a major plus for me over the new versions purportedly arriving with 4 USBC ports only  adapterfree compatibility with everything I need  HDMI USB 3 and SDXC  This is important to anyone who has to work with colleagues still using thumb drives CDs SD cards and date projectors without Apple TVInitially I was slightly concerned about the legitimacy of the product but it came NIB all original parts wrappings with seals intact and the ability to purchase full 3year AppleCareRead full review Apples 154 MacBook Pro wRetina Display  ForceTouch Trackpad is a truly redefining piece of unprecedented technology designed and assembled to increase the range demand and atmosphere of consumer productivity across all platforms By transforming the machine itself Apple presents a durable and promising tool that suits mediums established on professional personal and educational levels for an experience harnessed by the computers multifunctional abilities Not only does the MacBook Pro exceed traditional options in performance but also with its stunning power to become singular in the routines of the user Altogether Apples MacBook Pro wRetina Display sets a new standard in its field made specifically for every aspect of imaginationRead full review This computer is absolutely wonderful  The 2015 MacBook Pros are the best laptops Ive seen including Apples more recent models  Super light sleek huge beautiful display fast silent reliable good autosaving if you let the battery run out great keyboard and trackpad nice speakers still has the ports that are most important to me doesnt get particularly warm even with extended use good OS options My only complaints so far arent about the computer itself 1 The charger it came with burned out within a month and might have been a fake I solved this with an old charger and the 10 Magsafe 1 to 2 adapter from Apple 2 Pages is currently a terrible program compared to Word or Apache But those are just tangential issues not the computer itself I love this laptop and will recommend it as the best all around laptop till Apple fixes the butterfly keys and other issues with the new Macs or another company surpasses itRead full review Well I did not expect it would be as it was shown in the pictures But this seller just surprised me I was thrilled when the computer arrived in just 3 days of time and it was in excellent condition The computer works perfectly tested the product thoroughly before even installing my old computers backup into this machine Drained the battery out and filled back to see how it is But again that surprised me too I meant to say that the battery is in excellent condition The MacBook Pro Retina display 15inch Mid2015 is 1895 on Amazon and expensive in others that I looked and finally ended up giving it a try on eBay But this seller has just sold me 1249 Plus Ive got Keyboard cover snap cover for the machine also MS Office 2016 And the fact I like about this seller is that hes instantly responsive to your text or message  I was answered all the questions instantly or no later than an hour Highly recommended You dont get such a seller in these day and age on eBay Note Dont worry about the scam This seller is totally genuineRead full review In a time where the cost is more for less this hardware stands out as a good buyHas all the speed storage and memory that most users would ever need The display is still very crisp and meets or beats a lot of other machines on the market It has all the ports that I still use and are more than efficient or sufficiently available for media needs without carrying multiple adapters Light weight enough for everyday carry Not many people I know hike 10 miles on foot into workSo yes a great value in an overpriced economy for machines that barely if at all best the 2015 rMBPRead full review At 1599 could not have received a better value than the 15 MacBook Pro There are zero complaints Move my wife from the Windoze platform that I just worked on everyday to keep running to a platform that you can really use and get things done especially with this awesome laptop Mac is just a pleasure to use Screen is outstanding Memory at 16 gb is awesome and the HD is lightning Bought it before the new one got too small and couldnt use all the great accessories I already have with my 13 MacBook Pro If you find it on sale pull the triggerRead full review With the the release of the 2016 Macbooks closing in its a good time to buy last years models because theyre dropping in price I use this machine for Web Dev and I love it The 154 inch screen real estate is awesome and allows me to have many things going on at once Also the retina display is fantastic Im overall really pleased with this device I recommend this to any developer or average consumer its a very nice machine Read full review I bought this to replace my aging 2011 Macbook Pro Just about everything has been improved  its lighter sleeker has USB 3 ports has a Retina display better colors better sound MUCH faster PCI based storage Definitely a huge improvement if you have an older Macbook Pro and the last model before Apple replaced all the ports with lightning ports removed the MagSafe adapter and removed the SD card reader If youre upgrading from an older model THIS is definitely the model to get at this timeRead full review First off this MacBook is upgradable to MacOs Catalina the current version as of this review Its very fast tons of memory great battery life looks greatIt can easily run Photoshop Chrome Excel Slack and a few other things at the same time Perfect for my job as a marketerRead full review This is simply the best notebook there is Im a long time ThinkPad fan had several models but when Apple debuted the first Unibody MacBook Pro I had to make the switch Since then Apple has been on the crownApple does not make these without SSDs  so every single MacBook is FAST Always easily outperforms 95 of all Windows Laptops simply because of the usage of a SSD People think they need a faster CPU to browse the web  none sense Most people dont use fast CPUs This Laptop has performance where it matters the mostThe weight and battery life are outstanding and industry leading They are very thin They are seamless no competitor is able to produce a clean chassis like this one The brand is instantly recognized every on the planetLets face the truth if you sit down with a Dell or HP in a Starbucks you look like youre a worker bee putting in extra hours on the weekend These devices have no sex in them The MacBook Pro is the laptop that everybody desires You know itRead full review Its a mid to high end laptop from the apple lineup and not everyone may want to pay the premium for itVery fast and responsive The 156 inch retina display and force touch features are great Its a much better experience programming in XCode on this configuration compared to the 13 inch screensRead full review Great laptop Yes itâ€™s from 2015 but donâ€™t let that stop you This thing is fast light for its size has all the ports you need built in so you donâ€™t need an adaptor It comes in very good condition mine only had the most minor scuffs on the bottom and a tiny dent that is only visible under perfect lighting It even handles video editing and video games nicely Overall for the price Iâ€™m thrilled with this laptop and I would buy it againRead full review Powerful and efficient Mac Pro and provides me with everything I needed I am glad I ran across this deal while browsing instead of going with the new Macs Prefer ports and old keyboard to the new additions at this pointRead full review Solid computer  Yes itâ€™s a 2015 but this has everything I want Mag power cord quad core processor 16 gb RAM and 512 fb storage Added bonus was the MacBook case keyboard cover and windows offVery response and shipped very fastRead full review The 2015 in my opinion is the best deal on a 15â€\\x9d MB Pro at present Fast brilliant retina display sweet form factor Even five years later the machine is totally currentAbsolutely love this purchaseRead full review After fighting with Windows from 31 to Win 10 I was tired of all the problems When my Win 10 PC kept crashing I decided it was time for a change I bought this laptop  my first Mac and have never regretted that decision They are a bit more costly than a PC because they are worth it I have had ZERO problems with this Macbook Startup is instant and I never have to reboot Need a new laptop go for a macRead full review I decided to make the switch to Mac OS after my Windows laptop died and this Apple MacBook Pro fits the bill Its lightweight very powerful and is surprisingly easy to use Ive never used Mac OS and there is a bit of a learning curve but once you get the hang of where things and how to navigate its quite simple to use Love the snappy backlit keyboard and Im banking on that Apple dependability for many years to come Highly recommend for anyone on the fenceRead full review Im very happy with the purchase The Macbook is just like new still under manufacturer warranty I saved at least 500 compare to buying a new one Plus the Macbook is loaded with so many valuable softwares worth more than 1000  Delivered as stated The merchant is very trustworthy Thank youRead full review This MacBook was delivered as promised Itâ€™s in great shape and it works great Best price for this MacBook I could find and it came with a brand new battery Delivered on time even though the battery replacement was delayed ThanksRead full review This was one of the biggest purchases I have ever made so I was very hesitant Ive been needing a good laptop for college coming up as well as needing it to edit my photos I wanted to get a good quality one with good storage and a larger screen For everything I wanted new it wouldve been around 2000 This is a pretty decent price for all that it is I would say The shipping was so fast It came in three days  a week early And the quality is pretty dang good Barely any scuffs noticeable I love itRead full review My Macbook came with very few scratches screen is almost perfect and it works like brand new Definitely a good buy and better than expected Despite being a few years old this computer still has plenty of power and battery for the vast majority of people It works perfectly for my needs Although it may not give the best bang for the buck value as compared to windows laptops in terms of immediate components Apple has created a device that is optimized to do what it is meant to do and what it does do it does better than anything that windows can offer It may be pricy but in my mind I find that it is worth it if you know what you want and what youll be getting from an Apple computerRead full review This year model is the one I chose because it still had the features that complement my other Mac connections  The refurbished MacPro was in very good condition and I just needed reorientation on how to go about setting it up especially using the VocMac guide tourRead full review For any price under 1600 it is a steal The performance is great and the quality is top notch With the new Mac Books set to be release in late October grabbing a heavily discounted older model is a great alternative If your lucky enough to still be eligible for Apple care protection I would also invest in that too Extending your warranty for three more years for support in case of any issues  Side note The new Mac books may not even have the standard USB ports and HDMI port Rumor has it they are set to be released with USB C which could add extras fees

YOUR A professional music producer and videographer and need the power You can always add an external gpu if you need more power when youre doing high definition videos but that another story capabilities are endless with the thunderbolt 3 bandwidt The only con is you cant upgrade the RAM  and video card  so far so good for me I hope this helpsRead full review The laptop is from open box and works great  I love the amount of storage space and the feature to prolong battery life ProsAll updates albeit not that prominent on this macbook 16 are meaningful For example  the return of magic keyboard the pysical ESC button and fingerprint button indicate that Apple does take the feedbacks and comments from its customer seriously And the update for the screen conveys a great sense of aestheticsConsThe improvement for speakers are not as good as expectedThe video camera is still 720p the longest last legacy device used on MacBook  is it that hard to update to 1080pRead full review My unit came super clean looked brand new I use it for music production Runs my Universal Audio hardware and software flawlessly i9 8 core intel processor with 1TB SSD Massive improvement Great value for money and pride to own one Love it Love the touchbar The dictating capability Iâ€™m a huge fan Came real fast and since it was an open box I was expecting some signs of use but it was impeccable

screen is incredible 13 weighs way less than a 15 and easy to hold and move aroundI put a cheap black cover for it and it looks awesomeI used it for low GPU gaming and worked greatI highly recommend buying an SSD and 8GB of memory or more then you are setRead full review I am deeply disappointed in the battery life of this laptop It is said by the seller that the battery is new and will last for 7hours but this battery doesnt last for even 2 hours when in minimal use And wen being used 1 hour and about 10mins to be exact Then when it needs to charged  it takes forever to charge like a good 10 hours smhRead full review The new 13inch Apple MacBook Pro brings a lot of new features to the table from the previous generation Users now get a large battery that gives pretty amazing life a better display faster processor FireWire SDcard slot and best of all a lower starting price Getting more for less seems to be the trend during this slow economy so is there any reason not to buy the new 13 MacBook ProBuild and DesignThe 133 MacBook Pro is very sleek and classy which is what we have come to expect from Apple The design is sharp with the unibody chassis showing no panel lines or breaks except on the bottom for the huge panel that covers the internals Apple gives us a very simple interface with little clutter and ports turning what is usually a mindless appliance into a work of art To further simplify the design they switched to an internal battery for this model instead of having a cover and release bar like in the previous revisionMSRP 1199PROSExcellent battery lifeGreat build

and it charges well The only problem is I wasnâ€™t expecting to have a Spanish keyboard but itâ€™s not that different Also my sound may stop working occasionally but itâ€™s rare It doesnâ€™t take pictures either Camera still works but no pictures Luckily I only need mine for typing and work Besides the keyboard and the sound everything else is greatRead full review I love this Mac It has the perfect amount of hard drive space I love it because it has enough space to be a great Mac as well as space to left over to run Windows which I use for when Mac wont run a Windows application I did upgrade the RAM as I notice it lag just a little bit and now it runs very smoothCame with lots of extra applications above the stock ones which was nice as wellRead full review I received mine with a couple decent scratches on the lid expected and a faint dark spot in the middle of the screen thatâ€™s apparent on a light background but other that Iâ€™m satisfied  Everything works great and the inside surface is very clean  I plan to upgrade to an SSD 8GB of RAM and a new battery and with that my total investment is still under 500good luck finding a better laptop with similar performance at that priceRead full review I ordered this laptop Feb 26 it was shipped Feb 27th and it was delivered a few hours ago today It came in a discreet box and was well protected inside Power chord was included There were a few scratches and dents but not anything major Iâ€™ve only been using it for a few hours and Iâ€™ve noticed the MacBook gets really hot but other than that it works perfectly fine and I will definitely be a return customer Only rated it 45 because I havenâ€™t had it long enough to give it 55 But so far Iâ€™m very pleased with my purchaseRead full review My concerns at downsizing to a 13 inch lap top have been erased as I find the weight and size more convenient for every day use without any negatives in practical useAs a musician I use my MacBook for live recording and for composition and find the battery life to be fineThe speed is amazing and Apples Garage Band I Movie and I DVD make production a joyTheres no doubt that the initial outlay of money is high but the ease of use and the elegance of the operating system make this a great valueRead full review I gave this to my niece after her Macbook died and she is enchanted it has more features and greater

PiperSupervisorSmall Business OwnerTeacherMechanicRead full review Its hard to get anything shipped to Alaska from the lower 48 especially with free shipping So far the machine looks and operates great The only problem I have with it is some of the keys donâ€™t want to respond unless I peck the keys hard a few times The number 2 key w e s and d  are the main problem keys Other than that Iâ€™m very happy with my purchase Thank youRead full review ive always used windows so i am having a little trouble getting used to mac  not having a rightleft click button was odd at first  it doesnt close

bought it was bc mac is supposed to be alot saferRead full review Considering it is a late 2011 MacBook Pro it has very good specs Decent amount of hard drive space for a mix of creative projects and customary work or school use Enjoy having the versatility of going back and forth between both spectrums A few minor dents but it is well worth it for the price Would definitely consider my next purchase from this sourceRead full review I have been using this computer for over a month now and i have not had any problems with it so far First impression i thought it had a little more cosmetic damage then i was expecting such as dents and overall fragilness However performance wise i have not had any issues and the computer continues to work great I have downloaded the latest apple OS mavericks as well as the latest versions of iTunes without any problems The battery life is not the best but i keep mine plugged in for the most partoverall this is a good deal and would recommend to

how it flowedthe speed take getting us tobut I had to have a mac So satisfyingly RetinaI canâ€™t come up with words to justify what an amazingly modern technological marvel it is Apple is truly in a great place Their products transfer me to another time and place like there is not even a barrier between the real world and the one I am viewing Couldnâ€™t be happier with speed and processing power and overall value and pricing and brightness was stunningly gorgeous This machines technical specifications appeared to have speakers and brightness and other exceptional features far beyond my anticipations and beyond that of any of its predecessors One quick benchmark test proves its a solid machine Read full review Awesome communication FAST SHIPPING best value for your dollar with all the additional applications they install for you The product came in on time per the ETA given Everything was pristine it was shipped with ample bubble wrap padding  some sort of thick shipping paper material The machine itself didnâ€™t really seem to have any visible wear so far as I can tell when I received it if you nit pick you see 1 tiny small scratch or dead pixel in the middle of the screen but again itâ€™s completely negligible for everyday use The laptop is very lightweight runs Mac OS like a champ with minor hiccups by the Touch Bar but can easily be fixed by going to sleep mode and waking the machine right back upRead full review A great product for those who is looking for an upgrade Nice and sleek It will take a while to getting used to but nonetheless a loveable computer This

pleased with this laptop Already using it and its wonderful Great doing business with you MacBook Pro What else can be said Matches very well with the nickname DongleBook Have bought 4 products from these guys over the past couple of months and they never disappoint I bought the MacBook Pro 2016 brand new in box Nothing against the performance however after I set it up I felt the Macbook is not complete I could not use my mouse or transfer my pictures right away from the box Because it did not have the ports I needed Apple advertises once and you can start using the Laptop after u opened the

ConditionÂ\\xa0preowned  Sold byÂ\\xa0cellelectronix If you want a horrible quality plus non functional MacBook with touch bar Then go ahead This macbook pro is perfect   Love it Feels amazing and works great Great This laptop is great I love the power and speed of it This laptop connects to the internet bluetooth location you name it and it does it fast This laptop has a quick 280GHz Intel Core i7 processor which is a great processor but gets really hot at times especially if you are using an aluminum unibody macbook pro I love the size of the screen and how bright it is This laptop is big and wouldnt be the best for someone who takes it everywhere but I use it mainly at home and it works greatRead full review Expensive but my favorite computer  Much faster than Windows  Beautiful bright screen youll love it After fix the logic board an excellent machine reliable and fast love it its worth every penny i bought it for my dad and he loves it and so do i the only thing i disliked a bit was the size of it kinda big afterall but well worth it Thankyou Very Much Exellent Condition I Love ItThankyou   love it great condition Great computer for those doing heavy duty graphics or architectural work The I7 processor is loads faster than the dual cores and the 17 screen and beefy graphics card mean it renders things quickly and your eyes wont go bad in the process Great Computer for anyone needing power a big screen and easy portabilityRead full review jai pas gagner lenchere mais on me la colerbought the NewPhone 74205 three weeks ago and was immediately impressed with the number of features available on this inexpensive phone It has a 1Mpixel camera video camera and speakerphone The NewPhones size is perfect for carrying in a pocket and the battery has a pretty good lifespan of roughly 4 hours My only complaint is that the menu system on the phone makes you click four times before you can find someone in the address book set an alarm or perform a additional functions Other phones Ive owned have simpler menus and get you to important features easily Overall Id recommend the phone if youre on a budgetRead full review This bad boy has 3 This is the best macbook pro you can ever buy super fast affordable beautiful screenThe Ram is enough to do anything the 7200 rpm hard drive and SSD give you performance boost I love this laptopRead full review Ive had earlier models of the Macbook Pro 17 before so I knew what to expect  I didnt buy a new model from Apple as they had discontinued the 17 size model Works well for a kids remotelearning tool where a current Macbook or Macbook air would be overkill and twice as expensive but still runs MacOS The screen isnt the highestresolution retina type but its bright and more than enough for worksheets and the like Speakers are plenty loud for schoolwork Pretty good battery life even with  300 cycles already at the time of purchase Sturdy  survived a tumble down the stairs with a pretty big dent but no loss of functionality as far as I can tell I dont think this 2017 model air has a T2 so it hopefully will be possible to upgrade the ssd later if neededRead full review Just arrived with a huge dent in it after long wait without a computer Box wasnt very sturdy no packing slip but pristine so didnt happen in shipping  A dent this significant at least deserved mention in the item description No I need to hire a tech to look at it to make sure the connections and everything else is ok I dont see how a dent this bad didnt damage delicate connection This was also a very important and very expensive investment for me living on fixed income of about 730mo a Covid survivor who is still very sick and has been depending on laptop for shopping video doctor visits  paying bills and so on so paying for a tech and living with this uncertainty is very troubling Read full review This is a 2017 MacBook Air and the quality is great Not a lot of memory but that can be fixed with an external drive The screen looks awesome for those people that are working with photo shop or any kind of visual effects The Mac is very light and at 133â€\\x9d this laptop in not to big and not to small itâ€™s just a perfect size If your looking for a good quality MacBook Air this is the computer for you but remember that this middle doesnâ€™t have a lot of memory and if your working on videos of high quantity of photos your going to need an external driveRead full review I was really hesitant at first buying a MacBook on eBay Especially one that claims to be unopened NIB etc but I got the package and it was wrapped with care and the box still had itâ€™s plastic on it Great value and excellent customer service So far so good with the laptop Thanks Read full review Apple Mac Air laptop 13  for our Grand daughters first year university She opened the box turned it on opened the program and followed the process of loading your info as noted in steps First she indicted how fast it worked and loaded and how easy to transfer all her old Mac data in to it Lets put it this way is a great light weight fast computerRead full review I just got it today everything looks brand new  great to me It came in the original packaging sealed with the plastic  all I will write an update if anything changes This MacBook Air is very light and easy to carry around with me I use it at home most of the time and it doesnt weigh me down Its powerful enough to use it as a office laptop or to play games from Apple Acarde I recommend this MacBook to first time computer users or switching from Windows to macOS Thank youðŸ˜ƒðŸ˜ƒðŸ˜ƒðŸ˜ƒðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜ŠRead full review Best value for money not just from apple but compared to any existing laptop out there Light amazing battery life great durability and impressive performancelong versionIve been using the Air series for the past 6 years so has my wife and i have to say that there are only words of praise It is extremely reliable very good battery and very lightweightI use it mainly for business which involves a lot of coding but i often use image and video editors and it never felt lagging And this is while having on average 60 browser tabs opened almost constantlyI recommend you to buy it if youre a student freelancer traveling or moving around a lot Here are some useful tips that might save you plenty of headache the retail price is around 1000 and depending on the model goes higher But from my experience you should be able to get a deal of 750 at least once in 2 months so dont rush throwing away the cash pay attention to sweaty palms they may leave a permanent whitish stain wearing metal armbandswatches and cufflinks may scratch the thin side the most fragile element of all is the power cord Make sure you dont wrap the cord very tightly when transporting it the biggest enemy of the battery seems to be Chrome I can normally use it with 60 tabs for 45 hours but i heard others getting way more time if using safari so keep that in mindRead full review I definitely recommend this product It looks like it is brand new out of the box It just had one minor scratch at the bottom of the laptop Works and looks perfect otherwise Wont be buying brand new ever again Read full review Very nice computerand newer model Like new condition Recommend Grandson loves it Great computer My grandson wanted this for his first year of college and loves it Great price thanks I am really impressed on how good this machine performs Had a windows laptop before with a I7 quad core processor and this MacBook Air just destroys my old laptop It is thin and portable Highly recommendedRead full review Its a great fit for me as a college student Its light and small and easy to carry around in my backpack all over campus but its also big enough for everything that I use it for It took a while for me to adjust to a MacBook as its my first one and I still dont quite know how to use everything but the quality of the computer is great For the amount of money I spent it on so far it has been worth itRead full review I wasnâ€™t sure about how I felt when ordering the laptop not that I have it itâ€™s exactly as described unopened brand new and I love it I decided to treat myself to a new laptop What I wanted to spend wouldnâ€™t get me what I wanted So on Cyber Monday I went shopping I found my new laptop here at several hundred dollars below everywhere else I looked It was delivered today and itâ€™s made me a happy man Thanks for a great product at a great price Happy HolidaysRead full review We bought for a Christmas present for our Grandson Since he is a Senior this year we gave it to him early He LOVES it Thank You so much I purchased this MacBook for my special needs sister  I wanted something that was easy to use but lightweight  I have a larger MacBook so I knew she would be to use this without any problems  This MacBook is great  The only problem I had setting it up was she didnt have an apple account  Once I set that up setting the MacBook up was a breeze I purchased this on sale in November and got a great deal but it is a great deal at regular price  It easily syncs with other devices including her Ipod  The product arrived quickly and in excellent condition  Very happy with the purchaseRead full review After 9yrs with my 1st MacBook it was time for an upgrade This MacBook Air did not disappoint Fast and works flawlessly My only minor gripe would be that the metal edges of the laptops body is a bit sharp and tends to dig into the skin An after market plastic case remedied the issue but for the price of these laptops Apple should smooth out the edges With that said I absolutely love this laptop and hopes it holds out just as long as my first oneRead full review I am always skeptical to buy anything of this value from eBay but upon receiving this item it does seem to be brand new and in good working order Got my computer today honestly was a little bit skeptical because this was such a good deal Everything came as pictured Mac was in a Apple factory sealed box brand new  Everything works great very happy with this new Macbook AirRead full review Bought for my niece as a gift for going to university She loves it as its light as easy for her to carry in her backpack and its work great for the works she needed in university I agree with all the five star reviews Its a great machine with amazing battery life The track pad is sensitive and this is the first laptop Ive had with which I didnt feel the need for a mouse its light responsive and accurateNow the only but When I bought it two years ago I didnt care about the lack of HD camera But now I do This is my only reservation about this little wonder machine Still I looked at the price on todays ad and thought Maybe I should get the newer model and sell mine  Its still the best computer Ive ever ownedRead full review Perfect condition just like pic The Mac air arrived early The laptop works great no issues no blemishes was brand new as advertised I just live it so much and for such a good price too Although used it arrived in great condition  It has plenty of power and memory for everyday computing plus it just works  No weird issues that plague my Windows computer I found that setting up was fast and easy Itâ€™s light weight and it looks great Hopefully it last a longtime Arrived earlier than expected great battery and nice size screen Great product for the price and being Apple because sometimes Apple can be too expensive It does a good amount of things for a student maybe not for a person who needs more features for photography or design but it is great for a student high school and up Overall very convenient weight and will last a good amount of years until you need a new laptopRead full review I LOVE this laptop itâ€™s exactlt how it was described the ONLY thing is it does die kinda fast which is annoying but I donâ€™t know if thatâ€™s just how Macs are because Iâ€™ve only had a Mac desktop outside of this But other than that I love it I take it everywhere with meRead full review My wife loved getting her apple she uses it all the time and it is of good quality  and it works great Recommend you get it if you can The computer came in a factorysealed box  Works perfectly so far so were very happy with it and the excellent price It was also nicely packaged for shipping There was no signature required though and were glad we happened to be in at the time We would not have wanted this just left at the doorRead full review This is the best one I have ever own absolutely cover new in box carefully packaged The price is lower than in store and itâ€™s too match for student I bought this MacBook to upgrade from my 2008 model which was much heavier Not to mention slower I purchased it for a very good price and it has helped me do a much better job in my business I bought this MacBook Air for my daughter for Christmas and she totally loves it  She will use it for college and she is very happy with it so far Its my first experience with an Apple laptop I am absolutely delighted Great experience Absolutely worth the money Works great so far so good  Great product made by AppleI would recommend this Mac Air very goof value and performance Bought for daughter for her graduation gift Looking for a cover and case to go with it by ending maycanâ€™t seem to find any with this model number This is the first apple laptop product that I have ever owned and if the first few days of using it are any indication I will never be going backFast lightweight user friendly just overall a great machine thus farRead full review Brand new as described Works flawlessly Shipping was a little slow but laptop worth wait Great price I love my new MacBook  i5 CPU powerfulSSD fast and reliable 128G little bit small but everything will store online like google drive 128G for OS and temp data is enoughiOS much better than Windows 10 Chrome Linux etcLooks so coolRead full review I recommend this laptop for anyone who likes mac software and quick light portable laptops Would definitely buy again Highly recommend Its so fast without no lag  I love it Its a lot of money but its better to invest in a great product than paying money fixing the cheap ones Came early than expected wonderful and safe packaging all around good purchase Computer works perfectly Thanks Laptop arrived early in amazing condition Not a single scratch or scuff and screen is perfect They even included lots of extra cases and screen protectors This laptop is so fabulous What a steal I gave this as a gift to my husband who has a 10year old laptop for Christmas and he is LOVING it As we all know these products are sooo easy to learnuse He had a pc soHello Itâ€™s a whole new tech world for himRead full review Its exactly what I expected My daughter uses it for school since they are now virtual It handles all her school needs and syncs to her

Needed new computer for my daughter incoming college freshman I bought her a HP for Christmas and it mysteriously broke in July So after 6 months hp would not repair Do only Apple for now on And this computer is fast and smooth and liteRead full review Verified purchaseÂ\\xa0 Yes  ConditionÂ\\xa0new  Sold byÂ\\xa0batzmaruebiz The laptop even arrived early And it is in mint condition Works excellent wouldnâ€™t even know it was used before MacBook Air came brand new seller was super communicative and there were many shipping options Would recommend to anyone and everyone The laptop came as advertised fully loaded just needed to upgrade to the newest iOSHighly recommend Item was exactly as stated Looks brand new A little scratched on the bottom but other than that works great Came super fast which is a plus Thank you The body of these havent changed at all since the 2013 model They shouldve made the 2017 model a retina All that got upgraded was the memory to 8gb as the standard and the CPU got a unnoticeable boost to 18GHz from 16GHz Honestly if 4gb ram is sufficient for you get the 2014 modelRead full review Very happy with my new computer It came in a brand new package and it was a great price I expected a few blemishes and scratches but this was dented and separating and in Terrible condition I was excited and hopeful  but this deal is way to good to be true unfortunately   I think this computer was used as a football before getting refurbishedRead full review We Bought this for our 10 year old Son he Loves it Thank You This is the best laptop I have ever owned I use it for my college work and I am able to carry it everywhere to access my homework Itâ€™s light and compact itâ€™s fast and itâ€™s not as complicated to useRead full review On time deliverySecond purchase from declutter storeIm very satisfied with their products and sometimes look to the store first for an item I may be thinking of purchasing Well worth the money I cant wait to use it this upcoming semester  ABSOLUTELY PERFECT Exactly as described and it was delivered a week earlier than expected So happy I made the purchase THANK YOU I arrived just as the description said  My daughter loves it The computer was new in the box and everything works great Canâ€™t wait to use it for school next semester Older MacBook Pro laptops like this one offer excellent value for anyone who does not need the blazing CPU speeds offered by the new Mac towers and MacBook Pros If you are seriously considering a new MacBook or MacBook Air a 20122015 MacBook Pro deserves your consideration If storage capacity is important Other World Computing for a few hundred dollars more can help you out with 1TB or 2TB SSD upgradesRead full review excellent condition very little signs of wear its like it is brand new Love the retina display  USB 30 Very light  fast Better than expected and very happy with Infinity Precision teams responses whenever I had a question Highly recommend  I

more horsepower for video and photo work I was hesitant due to the size and weight of the older MacBook Pros but was very happy when I got my hands on it It really is a great merger of the older MacBook Pro and MacBook lines I dont understand the complaints about ports You have 2 USBC I picked up a HooToo Shuttle and a USBC to DisplayPort cable I dont need anything else 1 Drives up to a 5K display and the other one has 3 USB 30 ports an SD Card Reader and power delivery and also 4K HDMI support What else do I need and this makes it so easy to take the Laptop with me and not be encumbered The keyboard is very nice tooRead full review I bought the computer for my girlfriend when it came she went to set it up and a flashing folder with a question Mark came up We searched google to see what the problem was and we found out that there is an internal problem Probably needing a new hard drive   Was told that was ready for new user with the only problem was a space bar
